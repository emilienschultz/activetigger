# FAQ

## How can I recover my password ?

For the moment, the only solution is to contact the administrator of your service to reinitialize it for you.

## Can I launch processes if the GPU is already full ?

You need to wait for enough GPU memory to be able to launch your process. There is no queue system for the moment. You can try to decrease the batch size to lower the required memory.

## If I destroyed my project, is it possible to recover the data ?

No.

## I have bugs or repetitive problems

Please open a issue on the Github.

## I have just created a project but want to modify certain parameters (e.g., increase the trainset size).

Go to the project tab, navigate to Settings, and select Update Project. Please note that if you increase the size of your project, you then need to create a new feature in the Prepare tab.
