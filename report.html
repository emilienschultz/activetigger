The objective of cobots is to improve production performance by allowing a more efficient and scalable distribution of tasks between humans and machines. The idea behind these technologies is to combine the great mental capacities of humans with robots that can take on the fatiguing parts of jobs. Thanks to improved sensing and control abilities, robots gained major awareness.The thesis presents several contributions in the area of human-robot physical interaction.First, it proposes a method to predict human posture while a human interacts physically with a robot.Second, it describes algorithms and simulation tools to visualize the human ergonomics score associated with the movement of a human, in real-time, even when the human is physically coupled with the robot.Third, the thesis advances the knowledge on how to control and adapt the robot behaviour during collaboration, thanks to experimental studies involving humans and robots in comanipulation scenarios. The first study investigates the best impedance strategies for the robot to collaborate with the human during a co-manipulation of a pipe in a precision insertion task, while the second study investigates how humans adapt to changing impedance strategies of a robot during a collaborative sawing task.","The investigation of ionization dynamics of atoms and molecules illuminated with intense laser fields has attracted a great of interest in many disciplines over the decades. In this context, experiments of laser-matter interaction on the exploration of underlying mechanisms are considerably expanding with the advent of ultrashort femtosecond and attosecond laser pulses. However, the description of the laser irradiation process from a theoretical perspective is still a challenge, in particular for complex systems, such as the fullerene C60. To that end, we turn to exploit a fully fledged approach \"Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory (TDDFT)\" to describe electron emission induced by a broad range of laser pulses from weak to strong and from femtoseconds to attoseconds. The first part of the thesis contributes to the study of ionization dynamics of C60 irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses. Three ionization mechanisms, single-photon ionization, multi-photon ionization, and strong-field ionization, are extensively explored via photoelectron spectra (PES) and photoelectron angular distribution (PAD). Our analysis shows that for single-photon ionization, the PES basically reveal the occupied single-particle states which can be associated with the orbital depletion, and the PAD can be generalized into the anisotropy parameter which sensitively depends on the electronic states instead of the photon frequency. For multi-photon ionization, the PES are mostly generated by few uppermost orbitals, and the PAD reveal larger anisotropy with the increase of photon order. For strong-field ionization, the PES are featured by an extended plateau at high energies due to electron recollisions, and the delicate pattern on the plateau is analyzed by using a three-step model. The PAD of the high-energy electrons shows a strong alignment along the laser polarization, which is promising to generate a highly collimated electron beam. Moreover, we also discuss temperature effects from ionic motion on the PES and PAD. The second part of the work focuses on the ionization dynamics of simple atoms and molecules subject to extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses in the presence of an infrared (IR) field. Using similar laser parameters as experiments, we find that for He atom it leads to subcycle ionization on the attosecond time scale depending on the delay time between IR and XUV pulses, while for Ar atom this is absent. To better understand it, we make a systematic study on the effect of key laser parameters in the IR regime. Our results reveal that IR laser intensity and XUV frequency are decisive parameters. We further study resonance effects on electron emission in Na2 molecule, and we find that ionization pattern can be related to either IR laser frequency or the eigenfrequency of the system. We then extend it to the mid-IR (MIR) regime, where more complex ionization patterns are observed. Finally, we develop a schematic model accounting for electron emission in two-color laser field, and an analytical solution of ionization probability is also obtained, which well explains the main characteristics of the ionization pattern.","Nanotechnologies rely on the introduction of strain engineering to enhance semiconductor devices performances. As a consequence, non-invasive characterization methods with high spatial resolution and strain sensitivity on low-amount-of-matter samples are required. This PhD work focuses on methodology of X-ray diffraction techniques performed in the Bragg geometry, which allows probing the structural properties of crystalline samples. Firstly, the Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy technique, developed on a fast-timescale at the ESRF ID01 undulator beamline, is described through a thorough analysis of an experiment performed on ultra-thin strained SiGe-on-insulator patterns. Secondly, this manuscript focuses on two coherent diffraction imaging techniques, namely Bragg CDI, which yields complex density and strain map of nano-meso crystalline objects, and Ptychography, which use translational diversity to produce quantitative maps of complex transmission function of non-crystalline objects. The motivation developed in this PhD work is to combine these two techniques that both promote highly sensitive phase-contrast properties, in order to provide ultra-high resolution on complex\u002fextended samples. Bragg Ptychography is thus introduced, along with algorithmic descriptions and considerations on the X-ray beam characterization, the latter being still a key component for successful reconstructions.","The formation of synapses follows different steps including synaptogenesis and maturation. These different steps depend on coordinated pre- and post-synaptic assembly. Pre-synaptic proteins and ionotropic glutamate receptors play a central role in these processes. During my thesis, I have been interested in the implication of the presynaptic protein Bassoon in the maturation of the hippocampal mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell glutamatergic synapses. This synapse constitutes an attractive model for the study of synaptic maturation because it follows several steps of defined morphological and functional maturation. Bassoon in one of the first protein present at newly formed synaptic contacts. By electrophysiological approaches, we showed that Bassoon is important for the organization of the active zone during the first two postnatal weeks.Kainate receptors play an important role in the regulation of network activity during postnatal development. However, the impact of kainate receptors activation on synaptic maturation is less known. I showed a delay in functional maturation of mossy fiber synapses in mice deficient for the GluK2 subunit of kainate receptors (GluK2-\u002f-). To know if this delay is correlated to morphological alterations of this synapse, we setup in vivo lentiviral infections of membrane fluorescent protein (YFP) in mouse pups (P1-P2). Using confocal microscopy and 3D reconstruction, we described the morphological maturation of mossy fiber synapses. We were able to correlate functional and morphological maturation and our results also showed an impairment in the formation of mossy fiber synapses in GluK2-\u002f-. Together, these data reveal the importance of synaptic activity and of the coordination of pre- and post-synaptic assembly during synaptic maturation.","Condensed tannins are widely distributed and highly abundant in nature. In the past decades, such tannins have played an important role in thermosetting systems (e.g. adhesives for wood bonding, foam material) because of their chemical reactivity. However, they also exhibit great potential as a component of polymeric materials because of their physicochemical properties (e.g. antioxidant, antimicrobial and stabilizing properties), which are promising for material preparation. In order to transform tannins from traditional application to a broaden application in polymeric materials, the main challenge facing tannins are their incompatibility with hydrophobic polymer. For this purpose, three modification pathways were developed to improve the compatibility of tannins with PP or PLA matrix. In the first part, PP\u002f tannins were modified with hexamine or glyoxal via dynamic vulcanization technique. After vulcanized extrusion, vulcanized tannins present better compatibility and UV protective performance in PP matrix. The second approach is CTs modified with acetic anhydride. With this method, up to 30 wt% acetylated tannin (AT) can be well incorporated with PLA while PLA containing up to 20 wt% AT did not deteriorate the mechanical property and surface morphology. This PLA\u002fAT composites are printable via fused deposition modeling process. In the third part, the efficient reactive compatibilization have been successful used to improve the interfacial adhesion between PLA and CTs by using 3-aminopropytriethoxysilane, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, and dicumyl peroxide (DCP).","This thesis deal with the issue of the calibration of a group of sensor composedof an inertial unit, a magnetometer and a camera. It aims at integratingthem into a very compact system : a mini-drone. First of all, this study outlinesthe constraints imposed by the application on the choice of the sensors andthe solutions considered to solve the measures synchronization issue. Afterstudying existing calibration techniques, a method for the calibration of allthe sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and camera) is presented.The proposed solution allows to estimate the frame transformation between thedifferent sensors. It has the advantage of not requiring the use of any specialequipment. Furthermore, the integration of these sensors into a compact systemraises new difficulties. Under these conditions, the magnetic fields created bythe drone actuators disrupt magnetometer measurements. A new method isproposed to estimate and compensate for these magnetic disturbances. Thecompensation is dynamically adapted based on the state of the drone actuators.Finally, two applications of the system including an inertial unit and a cameraare presented : the construction of geo-referenced images mosaic and videostabilization. Both applications use measurements of inertial sensors and precisecalibration to perform a real-time processing for a very low computational cost.","Acute leukemias are a heterogeneous groups of malignant hematological diseases due to the clonaloncogenic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells(HSTs). We distinguish acute myeloblastic leukaemiafrom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALLs are classified according to the type of lymphoid precursoraffected, its degree of maturity, and with associated cytogenetic abnormalities.Treatment incorporating induction therapy,consolidation, and intensification \u2013 delayedintensification or allogeneic stem cell transplantation(SCT) according to prognostic factors \u2013 enable 80 to 90% of complete remission (CR). Nevertheless, long-termoverall survival is only 40 to 50% because of relapseand treatment-related toxicity. Different prognosticgroups based on cytogenetic abnormalities andmolecular biology are emerging and patients from eachprognostic group can benefit from adapted therapies.In chromosome Philadelphia-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) which used to be of particular bad prognosis, tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKIs) enables 80% of CR but with ahigh-relapse risk. We demonstrated that high-dosetherapy followed by autologous SCT enables prolongedlong-term survival with less drug-related toxicity ascompared to allogeneic SCT in patients with undetectable minimal residual disease. By showing the implication of autotaxine in the resistance to TKIs inPh+ LAL, we enable the use of novel therapeutics inclinical practice.T-cell ALL is considered of poor prognosis as one thirdof patients relapse. In this group of patients we showedthat the absence of a Notch and\u002for a FBXW7 mutation or the presence of mutations in RAS or PTEN identified a subgroup of patients in whom the treatmentmust be intensified. Our research has contributed to the identification of prognostic groups in ALL and to theadjustment of treatment according to potential survival.","Growth of living organisms originates from molecular events. These events add up, and generate cellular behaviors that together produce morphogenesis. In my PhD, I studied how such microscopic events contribute to plant morphogenesis. More specifically, in a first set of projects, we investigated the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis pavement cells by quantifying distribution of microtubule orientation and tip dynamics at subcellular scale. Disruption of microtubule patterning was predicted to lead to mechanical failure of cells, but we highlighted compensation mechanisms that prevented it. In my main project, we investigated the role of cellulose synthase guidance along microtubules via a protein called CELLULOSE-SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE 1 (CSI1). In the absence of CSI1, cellulose synthases follow previously deposited cellulose microfibrils, which should lead to increased alignment. Contrary to the current growth model where cellulose alignment is associated with growth anisotropy, we found that this did not lead to an increase in cell elongation and even led to a decrease of organ elongation in Arabidopsis sepal. Sepals also presented less anisotropic mechanical properties and displayed cells with a snake-like shape. At a multicellular scale, we found that spatial consistency of growth direction was impaired in csi1, which explains the reduced length of its organs, the reduced mechanical anisotropy of organs, and the defects in cell shape. Our results contribute to bridging knowledge between scales, from the cytoskeleton, to the cell wall and to plant morphogenesis.","Groundwater remediation is currently one of the major environmental challenges, considering the number of contaminated sites and the risk posed to human health and to the environment by exposure to groundwater contamination. Permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is a passive in situ technology for the remediation of contaminated groundwater. It consists of a barrier placed perpendicularly to the contaminant flow and made of reactive material that treats contaminant plume flowing through it under the natural hydraulic gradient. It is the most cost-effective groundwater remediation technology; it allows the use of surface land and reduces the exposure of workers to contaminants. The most used reactive material is Zero Valent Iron (ZVI), which is able to remediate groundwater contaminated by a large range of contaminants by means of different chemical and physical mechanisms. The main issue of granular ZVI use regards the reduction of the porous medium porosity, because of the expansive nature of corrosion products, precipitates and gas formation. To overcome this problem, mixtures of ZVI and granular materials were tested to investigate their long-term removal efficiency and hydraulic behavior. The use of volcanic Lapillus to be mixed with ZVI to remediate heavy-metals contaminated groundwater is proposed in this work. Tests on Lapillus showed a not negligible heavy metal removal efficiency of the volcanic material, while the hydraulic monitoring of column tests performed using mixtures showed a not high reduction of hydraulic conductivity over time.Modelling batch and column tests as a tool for understanding the mechanisms involved in the reactive porous media has been set up. The analysis of the sensitivity of the models response with respect to the input parameters has also been explored.","The time-domain BEM for the wave equation in acoustics and electromagnetism is used to simulatethe propagation of a wave with a discretization in time. It allows to obtain several frequencydomainresults with one solve. In this thesis, we investigate the implementation of an efficientTD-BEM solver using different approaches. We describe the context of our study and the TD-BEMformulation expressed as a sparse linear system composed of multiple interaction\u002fconvolutionmatrices. This system is naturally computed using the sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV). Wework on the limits of the SpMV kernel by looking at the matrix reordering and the behavior of ourSpMV kernels using vectorization (SIMD) on CPUs and an advanced blocking-layout on NvidiaGPUs. We show that this operator is not appropriate for our problem, and we then propose toreorder the original computation to get a special matrix structure. This new structure is called aslice matrix and is computed with a custom matrix\u002fvector product operator. We present an optimizedimplementation of this operator on CPUs and Nvidia GPUs for which we describe advancedblocking schemes. The resulting solver is parallelized with a hybrid strategy above heterogeneousnodes and relies on a new heuristic to balance the work among the processing units. Due tothe quadratic complexity of this matrix approach, we study the use of the fast multipole method(FMM) for our time-domain BEM solver. We investigate the parallelization of the general FMMalgorithm using several paradigms in both shared and distributed memory, and we explain howmodern runtime systems are well-suited to express the FMM computation. Finally, we investigatethe implementation and the parametrization of an FMM kernel specific to our TD-BEM, and weprovide preliminary results.","A new easily accessible trialkyne phenol dendron has been developed mimicking the already known triallyl phenol dendron. A family of polyalkynyl containing dendrimers with 27, 81 and 243 terminal branches was obtained starting from the classical polyiodo dendritic cores of the laboratory. Ferrocenes were then grafted using \u201cclick\u201d chemistry. The dendrimers obtained allowed electrochemical sensing of both biologically interesting oxo-anions like ATP and metallic cations. Robust and recyclable modified platinum electrodes were obtained thank to the adsorption properties of large dendrimers. These electrodes are able to recognize the same ions as the dendrimer in solution. A novel series of glycodendrimers with 27, 81 and 243 modified xylopyranosides termini was synthesized too. The characterization methods for such nanoobjects were investigated, and particularly technics that allow to obtain the size of the molecules like dynamic light scattering (DLS) and DOSY NMR. Finally, a family of robust polyalkynyl containing dendrimers with 4 to 6 enlarged branches was developed. The functionalization with randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrins using \u201cclick\u201d chemistry is also reported.","Adhesive bonding is widely used in automotive industry as joining technique to ensure features as fatigue resistance and the assembly of different materials types and thicknesses. ArcelorMittal as steel manufacturer developed new anticorrosion coatings ZnMgAl, which must be compatible with epoxy adhesives. A new generation of crash adhesives greatly increases the adhesive properties on these new coatings in comparison to former adhesives. These adhesives contain two new components: silanes and glass beads. Model adhesives with simplified composition were formulated to understand how each of these components impact on adhesion properties on metallic substrates. Moreover, the surface of coated steels has been characterized to correlate surface chemistry and adhesion, particularly as for the presence of hydroxyl groups at the extreme surface. Coated steels were modelled by pure metallic substrates, constituting their surface chemical domains, namely zinc, magnesium and aluminum. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) terminated with hydroxyl groups were also developed to control the surface density of hydroxyl groups without impacting surface roughness and to evaluate the importance of the surface density of hydroxyl groups on the adhesion of crash adhesives. This was studied by peel tests, revealing that a minimal density of hydroxyl groups is required for obtaining good adhesion properties. Finally, the influence of glass beads incorporation in new adhesives was studied both experimentally and numerically to understand how it changes failure patterns without reducing shear strength.","The purpose of this thesis is to develop and suggest new dimensionreduction methods to construct composite indicators on a municipal scale. The developedstatistical methodology highlights the consideration of the multi-dimensionalityof the quality of life concept, with a particular attention on the treatment of mixeddata (quantitative and qualitative variables) and the introduction of environmentalconditions. We opt for a variable clustering approach and for a multi-table method(multiple factorial analysis for mixed data). These two methods allow to build compositeindicators that we propose as a measure of living conditions at the municipalscale. In order to facilitate the interpretation of the created composite indicators, weintroduce a method of selections of variables based on a bootstrap approach. Finally,we suggest the clustering of observations method, named hclustgeo, which integratesgeographical proximity constraints in the clustering procedure, in order to apprehendthe spatiality specificities better.","The electric conductivity of the emeraldine salt depends on the conditions of its synthesis (solvents and dopants) and post-synthetic treatment. The main objective of the present thesis is to demonstrate and interpret the correlations between the environment and the properties of the conductive form of polyaniline. In order to achieve this goal a new theoretical approach is developed with reference to the experimental data. In the theoretical section, we examine the influence of different dopants and solvents on the structure and properties of polyaniline. To achieve this, a variety of quantum chemistry methods is tested and a proper method is chosen. In the experimental part we use a new method for tuning of the intrinsic polyaniline properties without using solvents or dopants other than those employed in the synthesis. The calculations show that the theoretical description of polyaniline depends strongly on the choice of the method. Modeling the effect of solvent polarity (in this case by the PCM method) seems to be crucial for the reliable description of the interaction polianiline-dopant. The obtained results demonstrate for the first time that interaction of polyaniline with dopants depends on the chemical nature of the solvent and not on the dopant itself. In addition, the stability of the polaronic form (conducting) grows with the increase of solvent polarity. These findings correspond well to our experimental results that show the crucial role of the solvent (and not of the dopants) for the properties of polyaniline.","It is well-known that inertial particles tend to focus on preferential trajectories in periodic flows. The goal of this thesis was to study the joint effect of particle focusing and sedimentation on their transport through a model 2D fracture with a periodic corrugation. First, single-phase flow though the fracture has been considered: the classical results of the inertial lubrication theory are revisited in order to include asymmetric fracture geometries. Cubic corrections to Darcy's law have been found analytically and expressed in terms of two geometric factors, describing channel geometry. For weakly-inertial particles in a horizontal channel it has been shown that, when inertia is strong enough to balance out the gravity forces, particles focus to some attracting trajectory inside the channel. The full trapping diagram is obtained, that predicts the existence of such attracting trajectory regime depending on the Froude number and on geometric factors. Numerical simulations confirm the asymptotic results for particles with small response times. The influence of the lift force on particle migration has also been studied. In a vertical channel the lift is induced by gravity and leads to complex trapping diagrams. In the absence of gravity the lift is caused by inertial lead\u002flag of particles and can lead to chaotic particle dynamics. Finally, for dust particles in a vortex pair it has been shown that particles can be trapped into one or two equilibrium points in a reference frame rotating with the vortices. A full trapping diagram has been obtained, showing that any pair of vortices can trap particles, independently of their strength ratio and the direction of rotation","Although  morphological  hierarchies  are  today  a  well-established  framework  for  single  frame image processing, their extension to time-related data remains largely unexplored. This thesis aims to tackle the analysis of satellite image time series with tree-based representations. To do so, we distinguish between three kinds of models, namely spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal hierarchies. For each model, we propose a streaming algorithm to update the tree when new images are appended to the series. Besides, we analyze the structural properties of the different tree building strategies, thus requiring some projection methods for the spatio-temporal tree in order  to  obtain  comparable  structures.  Then,  trees  are  compared  according  to  their  node distribution,  filtering  capability  and  cost,  leading  to  a  superiority  of  the  spatio-temporal  tree (a.k.a. space-time tree). Hence, we review spatio-temporal attributes, including some new ones, that can been extracted from the space-time tree in order to compute some multiscale features at  the  pixel  or  image  level.  These  attributes  are  finally  involved  in  tools  such  as  filtering  and pattern spectrum for various remote sensing based applications.","The work presented in this paper focus on the synthesis and characterization of physico-chemical properties of original fluorocarbon surfactants for obtaining nanovectors models to determine the qualifications required for efficient transport of oligonucleotides in the field of RNA interference. Building on the extensive work reported in the literature and the laboratory expertise in the field of fluorinated amphiphiles, we are interested in the synthesis of two major families of compounds. One corresponds to compounds of G\u00e9minis type with two fluorocarbon chains, two polar head groups derived from carboxylic acids and an oxyethylene or polyamine spacer arm. The structure of these compounds is conducive to the formation of stable Langmuir films that used to study interactions with the oligonucleotide. The second family corresponds to monocatenar counterparts who spontaneously self-assembled in vesicles, that is to say 3D models nanovectors. The characterization of the behavior at the air \u002f water interface or in solution of these different molecules in the presence and absence of oligonucleotide allowed us to establish a number of relationships between molecular structure, physicochemical properties and complexation of the oligonucleotide. Preliminary tests of cell viability were performed on cells from human lung and have shown good cell viability at conventional clinical used concentrations and good stability over time. These studies suggest good potential for vectorization of these fluorinated surfactants but that still requires further study as the full characterization of complexes formed with DNA as well as tests for toxicity before testing cell transfection.","Using genetic resistance (especially quantitative resistance) is a major challenge for the design of more durable and environmentally friendly strategies in crop protection. If quantitative resistance is considered durable, underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The objective of the present work is to identify key elements underlying this type of resistance to favour its integration in crop protection. It started with the hypothesis that quantitative resistance is linked to quantitative differences (intensity and\u002for timing) of defence responses induced in the host plant by pathogen derived elicitors. We checked this hypothesis on tubers from 5 potato cultivars with variable levels of resistance against two taxonomically distant pathogens with distinct infectious strategies: the necrotrophic bacterium Pectobacterium atrosepticum causing soft rot and the hemi-biotrophic oomycete Phytophthora infestans causing late blight. A resistance ranking between cultivars has been established by quantification of disease symptoms caused by these pathogens. Simultaneously, induction of defence responses by the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) from the oomycete was studied by measuring the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds. Results provide evidence for a positive link between the level of quantitative resistance of potato to P. Atrosepticum and the intensity of defence induced by CCF, but a negative link for the pathosystem potato \u2013 P. Infestans. We also identified individual phenolic compounds positively linked with resistance level. Some of them (i. E. Chlorogenic acid and rutin) diminish growth of both pathogens in vitro, but others (i. E. Nicotiflorin) have no direct toxic effect. This suggests efficacy of inducible defence to be based on a combined action of direct and indirect effects. Taken together, our results point us to a more complex mechanistic model for quantitative resistance than supposed by our initial hypothesis, integrating physiological aspects of induced resistance with infection linked life history traits of the pathogen.","The theme of this thesis is spatial extreme value theory and we focus on continuous max-stable processes. We begin with the convergence of the maximum of independent stochastic processes, by using the convergence of empirical measures to Poisson point processes. After that, we determine the regular conditional distributions of max infinitely divisible (max-i.d) processes. The representation of max-i.d. processes by Poisson point processes allows us to introduce the notions of extremal functions and hitting scenario. Our result relies on these new notions. Max-stable processes are max-i.d. processes, so we give an algorithm for conditional sampling and give an application to extreme precipitations around Zurich and extreme temperatures in Switzerland. We also find a upper bound for the \u03b2-mixing coefficient between the restrictions of a max-i.d. process on two disjoint closed subsets of a locally compact metric space. This entails a central limit theorem for stationary max-i.d processes. Finally, we prove that the class of stationary maxstable processes with the Markov property is equal, up to time reversal, to the class of stationary max-autoregressive processes of order 1.","Eukaryotes represent significant component of the mammalian intestinal tract. Their occurrence might have either beneficial or virulent parasitic effects on the host.A total of 16 fungal species and 2 other micro-eukaryotes were identified in healthy fecal sample. Contrary, a very few fungi were detected in the fecal sample from patient with resistant tuberculosis. On another hand , The diversity of eukaryotes inhabiting non-human primates such as great apes remains relatively unexplored .For these reasons we undertook an extensive molecular analysis for detecting eukaryotic microbiota including some human eukaryotic pathogens in a single fecal sample from a wild western lowland gorilla from Cameroon, and then followed by specific molecular detection of potential human eukaryotic pathogen in gastrointestinal tracts of wild population of gorillas. Our effort resulted in retrieving 87 eukaryotic species. We also reported the occurrence of pathogenic fungi, parasites. To further examine whether these gorillas harbor other sever parasites, we screened 91 of their fecal samples for the presence of blood borne pathogen such as Leishmania. The results showed that, 12 fecal samples contained Leishmania parasites, and 4 contained phlebotomine sand fly vectors. The molecular identity was determined by running 3 different polymerase chain reaction tests for detection of Leishmania major.","For a bottom-up approach, the catalysed growth of nanowires opens the way for numerous applications: vertical nano-transistors with a surrounding gate, core-shell heterostructures and so on. . . With these new devices, new questions emerge concerning catalyst or surface influences on the nanowire electronic properties. My work, based on a spectroscopic study with photoluminescence experiments underlined the predominant role of the surface on the electronic properties of nanowires. The surface state passivation allowed to observe the radiative recombination of free carriers of a dense phase: the electron-hole liquid, in gold- and copper-catalysed nanowires. This liquid phase has the singularity to be stable and its density is constant. This property is unique in semiconductors and led to a quantitative study of the influence of the surface via a modification of the surface\u002fvolume ratio. An original method for the surface recombination velocity (SRV) measure has been developed and very low SRV have been measured which is linked to an efficient passivation of surfaces states. The volume properties of gold-catalysed nanowires were found to be very similar to those of standard bulk silicon used in micro-electronics. Finally, the sacrificial oxidation of silicon allowed to obtain nanowires whose diameter were smaller than 10 nm. The progressive oxidation of nanowires allowed the observation of a shift of the PL line towards lower energy attributed to strains, then the increase of the gap energy is correlated to the carrier quantum confinement.","Emergence over the last few years of high throughput technologies like DNA microarray and more recently next generation sequencing now allows an exhaustive analysis of genome with several regulation levels including expression measure of all cell genes, DNA \u2013 transcription factors interactions, and also DNA methylation. It thus becomes indispensable to integrate these different data to be able to understand and then to model all these mechanisms involved in global cell function. This understanding will then enable to apprehend the sources of deregulation involved in many pathologies. The goal of my PhD is to understand the impact of PRC (PGC-1 Related Coactivator) transcriptional coactivator on the coordination of mitochondrial and cellular proliferation, from human tumor cell line XTC. UC1, rich in mitochondria. To do so, PRC and transcription factors ERRa, NRF1, GABP, CREB and YY1 involved in these two processes have been studied with ChIP-chip. Positive genes for these transcription factors are then compared with transcriptome of the same cells under siRNA PRC effects. Integration of these different data of transcriptome and ChIP-chip, coupled with study of motifs discovery, will allow to construct the transcriptional regulatory networks necessary to the understanding of PRC pathways. These networks will make possible the detection of therapeutic targets allowing to correct pathological condition.","Today\u2019s batteries state of the art, especially those based on lithium (introduced more than 25 years ago), is showing these energy storage systems have mostly reached physical limitations (260 Wh\u002fkg). Upcoming future, with constant electrification of many devices (from the connected watch to the electric car) and their parallel need for longer energy autonomy, requires the development of high capacity batteries (\u003e 400 Wh\u002fkg). In this field, all-solid-state technology has many advantages over conventional commercial cells. In common commercial batteries, current flows through either liquids or polymers, but in solid state batteries it flows through a solid electrolyte. However, the main challenge to build efficient solid-state batteries remains the discovery of an electrolyte material with all the right properties (cheap, secure, stable, highly conductive...). Our recent discovery of a new class of superionic oxide conductors based on lithium or sodium pushed us towards the development of high energy solid state batteries. In particular, a rock salt structure was observed for entropy stabilized (Mg, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn)O with random occupation of the cation sites. We showed that these cations can be substituted by alkali ions (with an intrinsic charge compensation mechanism), or combinations of +1 and +3 elements (with a selfcharge compensation between the substituents), while keeping the rock salt structure. As such, the number of phases that can be synthesized in this system is impressive. Interestingly, the charge compensation mechanism that occurs in the case of the substitution by +1 elements could involve oxygen vacancies, thus providing a possible diffusion pathway for lithium or sodium. Following this pioneering study, we have thus shown that Li and Na substituted materials exhibit very large values of ionic conductivity, which makes them among the best oxide-based conductors and we have then also demonstrated their efficient implementation in both lithium and sodium-based all solid state batteries.","The objectives of this study are the experimental characterisatino of the stick-slip instabilities in a model granular material and the identification of relevant control parameters. As monodisperse glass beads are subjected to drained triaxial compression tests, five macroscopic parameters characterize the stick-slip phenomenon: the deviator drop, the jump in volumetric contraction, the intermittence of the axial strain, Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio. The stick-slip events simultaneously affect the deviator stress and the volumetric strain. While the global material behavior is that of a loose sand, gradually contracting and hardening as it approaches its large strain critical state, its response in the \u201cstick\u201d phases immediately following the \u201cslip\u201d instabilities is similar to that of dense, dilatant sands, with a unique, linear stress-dilatancy relationship. Stick-slip events disappear beyond a critical axial strain rate, depending on the confining stress and on the grain diameter. The Young modulus associated to wave propagation varies with the confining stress according to a power law. The quasi-elastic modulus measured at the beginning of the stick phase is constant inside the elastic domain, as well as the Poisson ratio. The evolution of grain size and shape after one or several triaxial tests is monitored by laser granulometry and image analysis. The gradual vanishing of stick-slip events, on repeating the tests, is likely related to the global decreasing trend of average particle volume and to the formation of non-spherical objects, apparently by some phenomenon analogous to sintering.","After an introductory part, where some basic definitions are provided and some motivations for the investigation are presented, the thesis is divided into two chapters. The first chapter concerns particular classes of polyominoes. After a presentation of the background and the introduction of notations, we introduce a unified approach to obtain generating functions for different statistics on directed convex polyominoes. The problem of counting k-convex polyominoes according to their semi-perimeter is a difficult problem: it is solved for k=1,2. In the last part of the first chapter we introduce two particular classes of k-convex polyominoes, namely k-parallelogram and directed k-convex polyominoes, and we solve completely the corresponding enumeration problem. The second chapter deals with permutominoes (polyominoes defined by pairs of permutations). It begins with a background and some classical enumerative results for particular permutominoes. We introduce a naturel generalization of permutominoes to any dimension and we obtain new enumerative results and other already known are recovered by a unified approach. Concerning the two dimensional case, we solve the open problem of the characterization of the pairs of permutations defining the column-convex permutominoes and we find a bijective proof for the number of directed column-convex permutominoes, that we know to be counted by factoriel numbers.","Risk analysis is a critical part for regulatory decision-making related to high-risk risk industries. A systematic risk analysis is made up of three steps: (i) identifying the undesirable risk scenarios. A risk scenario is characterized by referencing to the potential event with its causes and consequences. (ii) Estimating the likelihood of occurrence of risk scenarios. (iii) Calculating the effect of consequences of the identified risk scenarios. Likelihood and effect analysis are carried out with the help of models that depend on several number of input parameters.However, the trustworthiness of risk analysis is limited when inaccuracies in the results can occur, and are due to various sources of uncertainty. Parameter, model and completeness uncertainties are the main sources of uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty arises from the inability to set exact values for certain input parameters used for likelihood and severity analysis. Completeness uncertainty originates from not considering all contributions to risk in the identification process (some initiating events are ignored). Model uncertainty is not considered in this work.The INERIS (French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks) has developed an interval semi-quantitative approach that uses both quantitative information if available or qualitative information if not. However, this interval semi-quantitative approach has some drawbacks due to parameter uncertainty.Information regarding model parameters used for effect analysis is often incomplete, vague, imprecise or subjective. Moreover, some of the parameters may be random in nature and have different values. This leads to two different types of parameter uncertainty that need to be accounted for an accurate risk analysis and effective decision-making. Aleatoric uncertainty arises from randomness due to natural variability resulting from the variation of a value in time. Or epistemic uncertainty caused by the lack of information resulting, for example, from measurement errors, subjectivity expert judgment or incompleteness.Moreover, the identification step is incomplete where only safety related scenarios caused by accidental events are considered. The introduction of connected systems and digital technology in process industries creates new cyber-security threats that can lead to undesirable safety accidents. These cyber-security related events should be considered during industrial risk analysis.This research aims to develop uncertainty analysis methodologies to treat uncertainty in the INERIS risk analysis process. In other words, to analyze uncertainty in likelihood analysis, effect analysis and the identification step.In this work, we propose a fuzzy semi-quantitative approach to deal with parameter uncertainty in the likelihood analysis step. We handle the limits of the interval semi-quantitative approach by introducing the concept of fuzzy numbers instead of intervals. Fuzzy numbers are used to represent subjectivity in expert judgments (qualitative data) and covers uncertainty in the quantitative data if this data exists.A hybrid methodology that treat each cause of parameter uncertainty in effect analysis with the right theory is developed. Probability theory is used to represent variability, fuzzy numbers are used to represent imprecision and evidence theory is used to represent vagueness, incompleteness and the lack of consensus.A new risk identification methodology that considers safety and security together during industrial risk analysis is developed. This approach combines Bow-Tie Analysis (BTA), commonly used for safety analysis, with a new extended version of Attack Tree Analysis (ATA), introduced for security analysis of industrial control systems. The combined use of AT-BT provides an exhaustive representation of risk scenarios in terms of safety and security.","The main objective of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal and vertical variability of phytoplankton biomass in the open ocean. First, we investigated the variability of the relationship between the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp), a bio-optical proxy of the particulate organic carbon, and the chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) at a global scale. In subpolar regimes, concomitant changes in Chla and bbp correspond to variations in phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, in subtropical regimes, a decoupling between the two variables was attributed to photoacclimation processes or a change in the relative abundance of non-algal particles to the particulate assemblage. The Mediterranean Sea stands as an intermediate regime between these two end-members. Next, we analysed the seasonal and regional dynamics of subsurface Chla maxima (SCMs) in the Mediterranean basin by developing a classification of the vertical profiles of Chla and bbp. In the Eastern Mediterranean, SCMs corresponded to an increase in the intracellular Chla induced by photoacclimation of phytoplankton cells. However, in the Western basin of the Mediterranean Sea SCMs corresponded to an actual increase in carbon biomass at depth (SBMs). Lastly, we investigated the potentially significant contribution of SCMs to carbon production, by quantifying the gross community production in the subsurface layer. A method based on the diurnal cycle of bio-optical properties was used in order to estimate production in two distinct regions of the Mediterranean Sea during the oligotrophic season. Our study revealed that SCMs might contribute over 40% of the depth-integrated production in some areas, thereby suggesting the potentially important biogeochemical role of SCMs.","Growing interest in biomedical applications of nonthermal plasmas inspires the development of new plasmas sources. Dielectric barrier (DBD) and corona discharges produced in ambient air or in noble gas flow are typically applied. Direct production of plasma in liquids has a great potential for sterilization of liquid substances and extracorporeal blood treatment. The physical mechanisms of discharge formation in liquid medium are not fully understood.The first part of this thesis deals with the initiation and development of the nanosecond discharge in liquid dielectrics (deionized water, ethanol and n-pentane). Time-resolved shadowgraph visualization, optical emission spectroscopy and electrical diagnostics are applied to investigate the discharge formation on point anode.We have shown that depending on the applied voltage amplitude three different scenario can occur in the polar dielectric, namely, cavitation of a bubble, discharge development in the gaseous cavity (bush-like mode) and initiation of the filamentary discharge (tree-like mode) propagating in bulk liquid. Formation of the bush-like and the tree-like discharges is governed by distinct physical mechanisms, resulting in strongly different plasma parameters.In the second part of this work we address the question of how cold atmospheric plasma interacts with living cells in-vitro and in-vivo, and what is the mechanism of plasma induced cell death. Flowcytometry based cell viability assay with two markers AnnexinV (AV) and Propidium iodide (PI), demonstrates a dose dependent induction of the apoptosis for human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) and epithelial (HMEC) cells treated with DBD plasma. In nude mice model, induction of apoptosis and necrosis in dose dependant manner is observed by electron microscopy in thin epidermis sections. Histological analysis shows significant lesions appeared in epidermis, dermis, hypodermis and muscle as a function of treatment duration. Production of hydrogen peroxide in culture medium (PBS) exposed to DBD plasma is measured using selective fluorescent probe (Amplex\u00ae Red). Cell viability of human thyroid epithelial (HTori-3) and melanoma (1205Lu) cells demonstrates nonmonotonous dependence on H2O2 concentration. The major role of plasma produced hydrogen peroxide and DBD electric field is suggested.","Plasmodione is a benzylmenadione, synthetized as a flavoenzyme inhibitor. These enzymes use FAD as a cofactor and are involved in numerous biologic processes, including the regulation of the redox equilibrium through thioredoxin and glutathione metabolisms. Plasmodione is very efficient in vitro against all stages of the human parasite P. falciparum, especially on ring stages, and is a fast killer. The aims of my PhD were to monitor the ability of Plasmodione to block parasite transmission to mosquitoes and to characterized its mode of action. For that, I had to implement new protocols. My results showed (i) that Plasmodione decrease both the parasite development in vivo and its transmission to mosquitoes while acting on every sexual stage infectious for the mosquito. (ii) A derivative from the same chemical family, more soluble, is more efficient than Plasmodione, especially on asexual stages and on transmission. (iii) When compounds are directly deliver into mosquitoes, neither methylene blue or Plasmodione have an effect on the survival. (iv) Finally, the use of knock out parasites for the GR, GS, \u03b3GCS or GluPho genes suggest that the proposed mode of action of the benzylmenadiones has to be corrected and other flavoenzymes could be targeted rather than GR.","Recent studies have shown that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play essential roles in axon growth and guidance, processes involved in the establishment of neuronal circuits during development. To study these mechanisms in vivo, my project aimed at characterizing the role of the RNA-binding protein Hrp48, which belongs to the conserved hnRNP A\u002fB family. I showed that inactivating hrp48 function leads to strong and specific axon migration defects, including axon misguidance and overextension. Notably, I have observed that the frequency of hrp48 mutant phenotypes is much higher in females than in males. Moreover, I showed that the female-specific Sex-lethal protein ectopically accumulates in the nucleus of mutant cells. This abnormal nuclear accumulation could explain the sex-specific defects observed in axonal migration. In parallel, I could show that inactivation of sema-1\u03b1, an Hrp48 putative mRNA target, causes defects similar to those observed in hrp48 mutants, and that hrp48 and sema-1 \u03b1 genetically interact. Moreover, the overall levels of sema-1 \u03b1 transcripts are much lower in females than in males. These results suggest that sema-1 \u03b1 misregulation may induce the sex-specific defects in axonal growth observe upon hrp48 downregulation. Tis work has allowed us to propose a preliminary in vivo model for a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism controlled by a member of the hnRNP A\u002fB family. Furthermore, it has revealed cryptic differences between females and males in the context of recent studies revealing sex-specific differences in the control of gene expression.","One way to produce Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) consists in adding chemicals to bitumen. Although several! kinds of additives are available on the market the mechanisms of this technology remains still not well understood. This thesis realized within a partnership between TOTAL and the Laboratory of Tribology and Systems Dynamic is focus on three axes to get a better understanding of these mechanisms. One singularity of our approach is due to the fact that experiments were performed at industrial processing temperatures (90\u00b0C- 165\u00b0C). ln a first lime, a rheological study has shown that bitumen exhibits a Newtonian behaviour at mixing and compacting temperatures. Bitumen viscosity mainly depends on temperature but in not very affected by the chemical additivation. We suggest that the bulk rheology is not adapted to understand the phenomena which are involved and we propose to study the behaviour of thin films of few tens of microns instead. ln a second lime, a tribological approach was employed to better understand mechanisms involved in binder\u002faggregate systems. Friction tests were performed with model materials. Results are that the friction answer is not sensible to the presence of additives but ta temperature in hydrodynamic lubrication range. ln boundary lubrication range, the response is material-, temperature- and additive-dependant. Finally, results of an interfacial study have shown that the interfacial tension of bitumen and that the wettability of aggregates are not very sensitive ta additives when the experiments are performed in air. When performed in an aqueous medium, interfacial tension measurements and wettability tests clearly allow to reveal the surfactant behaviour of effect of some additives. The combination of the three approaches allow a better understanding of phenomena which are involved at bitumen\u002faggregates and aggregates\u002faggregates interfaces.","The solar UV radiation that reaches the earth\u2019s surface is composed of 10 % UVB (280\u2013320 nm) and 90 % UVA (320\u2013400 nm) the main toxic radiations (wavelengths below 300 nm) being blocked by the stratospheric ozone. Unlike UVB, the UVA component of solar radiation is weakly absorbed by DNA. Nevertheless, one of major problems due to UVA exposure is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the interaction with endogenous and exogenous chromophores. These ROS cause damage to DNA, lipids and proteins. Even if UVB remains the major etiological factor known to be implicated in photoinduced cutaneous carcinogenesis, a novel role for UVA via the production of ROS seems to emerge. In our lab, previous works have provided evidence that exposure of mammalian cells to UVA-induced ROS led to delayed S-phase and reduced DNA synthesis, by a yet unknown process, which does not require a functional DNA damage checkpoint response, despite ATM-, ATR-, p38-dependent pathways activation. The authors proposed that inhibition of DNA replication is due to impaired replication fork progression and\u002for origins activation, as a consequence of UVA-induced oxidative damage to proteins rather than to DNA. The project for my PhD thesis is to better understand the mechanism underlying this UVA-induced slowdown of DNA replication in human cells.To study at the molecular level the effects of UVA on DNA replication, we used the DNA combing methodology. This technique allows measurement of the fork velocity and of the origins density. We show that UVA-induced ROS inhibit immediately after irradiation, but transiently, the progression of replication forks, while the inhibition on the initiation of originslasts longer. By HPLC-MS, we show that UVA radiation induces a moderate and transient decrease of the level of each intracellular dNTP. The supply of ribonucleosides doesn\u2019t seem to be sufficient to restore neither a normal forks velocity immediately post-UVA nor the overall slowdown of DNA replication. In addition, we observe a reversible oxidation of the subunit R1 of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme which is involved in dNTPs biosynthesis. This oxidation cannot explain the transient reduction of dNTPs pool after UVA exposure, but other types of RNR oxidative modification could affect its activity. During UVA irradiation, the presence of the antioxidant sodium azide (NaN3) prevents the delay of DNA replication, limits the oxidation of the subunit R1 and the decrease of dNTPs pool. These results strongly suggest that the slowdown of DNA replication totally depends on ROS, in particular on singlet oxygen production induced by UVA.Altogether, our data indicate that UVA irradiation affects the process of DNA replication by modifying the forks velocity and the activation of origins. As DNA replication impairment is a major cause of genetic instability, it is of importance to determine if UVA irradiation leads to this instability in our experimental conditions. Finally, we suspect that the target of UVAinduced ROS is essentially cytosolic and that the mechanism driving the inhibition of replication is not specific of UVA-induced ROS, but could be also observed with other types of oxidative stress.","Pain is not a direct read-out of sensory input, rather it is shaped by cognitive-affective factors that can amplify or reduce pain experience. A key aggravating factor is pain catastrophizing, an exaggerated negative mental set. It has been proposed that mindfulness meditation involves the cultivation of a present-centered metacognitive stance, labeled cognitive defusion, that counteracts elaborative thought processes like pain catastrophizing, while retaining openness to sensory experience, thus inducing sensory-affective uncoupling of pain experience. This tentative hypothesis has not been explored so far, which was the aim of the present work. We additionally explored the hypothesis that the chronometry of the anterior insula is a sensitive marker of sensory-affective uncoupling of pain experience. We applied a multidimensional approach that was informed by the phenomenology of mindfulness practices and aimed to address clinically relevant questions by combining experiential and experimental methods in the context of a novel fMRI-scanner acute pain paradigm devised to amplify the cognitive-affective aspects of pain experience in trained novice and expert meditators. We found that a style of mindfulness meditation labeled Open Monitoring reduced pain unpleasantness but not pain intensity compared to attentional distraction in novice (state effect) and expert meditators (state and trait effects). Trait pain catastrophizing predicted this sensory-affective uncoupling (Study 1). In addition, cognitive defusion showed a specific inverse relation to pain catastrophizing (that was robust to controlling for variance shared with other common cognitive-emotional constructs), and both constructs specifically predicted pain unpleasantness as opposed to pain intensity, with cognitive defusion showing strongest associations. No experiential dimensions were identified that mediated this relationship (Study 2). Finally, predictions on the anterior insula as a neural marker of sensory-affective uncoupling of pain were only partly confirmed. During pain anticipation, experts exhibited lower anterior insula activation in a cluster that negatively predicted self-reported sensory-affective uncoupling but did not correlate with pain catastrophizing scores. However, we could not confirm broader predictions on anterior insula function during pain and could not identify neural markers of self-reported state effects. Instead, we observed pronounced group differences in several prefrontal clusters during the reception and anticipation of pain that could be linked to subjective pain experience, consistent with a larger literature (Study 3).  These findings advance our understanding of the cognitive and neuronal mechanisms underlying mindfulness-based pain regulation and can be used to inform future contemplative neuroscientific investigations as well as treatment strategies for chronic pain","This work evaluates the contribution of the three fractions (RR, PR and EO) of Ak, Cs, Db and De from Gabon to preservation. For that purpose, a chemical analysis by GC\u002fMS of the three fractions was first made, then the study of their antifungal and antitermite activities, and finally the study of their effects in the protection of wood blocks following the attacks of the degradation agents. The results of the chemical analyses show that the HE are made up of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids, whereas the RB and RP are made up of a mixture of monoterpenes, monoterpenoids and triterpenes. Bioassays of the latter against PP, CP, CV and PS show low antifungal activity, but show high antitermite activity. These fractions improve the durability of the wood against fungi by 20%, and a good resistance of the wood blocks against termites. The latter, associated with Tebuconazole, increase the resistance of wood against wood degradation agents. Their leachable characteristics are clearly highlighted.","This thesis aims to develop electrochemical sensors based on ion assisted transfer reactions at liquid | liquid interfaces. The electrochemical device used is based on the formation of a micro-interface between water and 1,2-dichloroethane (water | DCE), obtained by a micropore drilled by a laser in a polyimide film. This micro-interface has been designed to obtain reproducible and meaningful measurements. Because water pollution by heavy metals is considered as one of the most important environmental problems, our studies focused particularly on assisted transfers of Pb (II) and Cd (II), alone or in mixture, by the 8-Hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ), and Ba (II)) by the 18-crown-6 ether (18C6). Cyclic voltammetry was used for understanding the mechanisms of transfer, and for determining the stoichiometry of the formed complexes. Complementary measurements by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry have confirmed these stoichiometries. All measures clearly show that the proposed experimental device is well suited for quantifying the electrochemically species, even if they are not electroactive.In prospects of industrial applications, we have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of the proposed device for online analysis. This process appears very promising because of its simplicity and its low cost, and with the possibility of reusing the organic solution for many measurements. Finally, in order to increase the sensitivity of the device, we also tested micropore arrays instead of a single micropore. We have clearly shown the interest in achieving lower concentrations values hence more representative of the environment. All studies in this thesis show how the used experimental device is promising and well performing.","Maps show geographic information of a given area in a simplified way, particularly when the scale is small. The simplification process, called cartographic generalisation, is submitted to several constraints : legibility, adequation to the abstraction level, and consistency with reality. The will to automate the maps creation process from geographical databases led to the creation of algorithms allowing the simplification object by object. However the choice of the algorithms, as their settings, are influenced by the object on which it is applied, and by the other objects in relation with this object (e.g. a building close to another one, a road parallel to a buildings alignment). This motivates the use of multi-agents models for automated map generalisation. Several multi-agent models were proposed, each of them having a different approach to manage multi-levels relations. Here, what we call a level is, for instance, the distinction between individual agents, like a building, and agents representing a group of other agents, like a urban block composed by the surrounding roads and buildings inside.We study the unification of existing models, using the multi-level paradigm PADAWAN, in order to simplify interactions between agents in different levels. We propose the DIOGEN model, in which the principle of interactions between agents of different levels is adapted to cartographic generalisation guided by constraints, those allowing to unify the existing models AGENT, CartACom and GAEL, and giving promising features.We evaluate our proposal on different case studies. Among them, we study the generalisation of trekking maps, where the routes are symbolized individually by a different couloured line symbols, like on bus maps. The presence of several route symbols on a same road leads to specific generalisation issues, like the choice of the side of each route symbol position, or the implications for the other objects on the map (e.g. points of interest, buildings) under the route symbol \u2013 issues tackled using our proposal of formal multi-levels representation.This work leads us to the identification of recurrent behaviours. We express them as analysis patterns, in a way that is independent from cartographic generalisation and constraint solving problems","This thesis studies combina\u00ad\u00ad\u00adtorial objects, with both an algorithmic and a combinatorial point of view. In the combinatorial part, we take care first, the enumeration of Catalan words avoiding pairs of patterns of length three, presenting the proofs of each case with various enumeration methods. Catalan words are particular growth-restricted words counted by the eponymous integer sequence. More precisely\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad, we systematically explore the structural properties of the sets of words under consideration and give enumerating results by constructive bijections or bivariate generating functions with respect to the length and descent number. Then, we study a sorting machine using two stacks in series where the first one avoids a pair of patterns of length three. The process consists of a right-greedy algorithm since we apply at each step the first possible transformation. In this dissertation, we primarily focus on the machines which sort a set of permutations enumerated by Catalan and Schroder numbers. For each class of such permutations, we give a characterization in terms of avoiding patterns which allow us to provide the exact enumeration. In the second part, being more experimental, we studied the optimization of permutation problems with genetic algorithms. Different kinds of encoding of the solutions have been considered to study the transmission of genetic properties in permutation problems. In particular, we used the Lehmer code, inversion table encoding, transposition array encoding, and inverse transposition array encoding during the process. Solution encoding describes the way decision variables are represented. Since indirect encodings are not sensitive to duplicates, they lead to a loss of genetic properties during crossbreeding. This contribution proposes a study of the impact of this loss both in the space of decision variables and in that of objective functions considering the four indirect encodings. In addition, after analyzing that the use of the Lehmer code and inverse transposition array preserve schemata after the recombination process, we proposed an adaptive crossover operator in order to be able to keep the prefix\u002fsuffix in order to see its influence on the transmission of genetic properties.","Higher competitiveness in legumes against weeds can help to enhance the sustainability of innovative cropping systems. Such an objective can be reached through a better ability to absorb soil nitrogen by the legume before the symbiotic fixation starts. Our study focused on the interaction between the presence of Rhizobium leguminosarum and the nitrate concentration on the root system architecture of Pisum sativum at the biomolecular and plant levels. Several experiments were carried out in rhizotrons and hydroponics. Our results demonstrated that a higher nitrate concentration tended to reduce the development of secondary roots regardless of the presence or absence of Rhizobium in the rhizosphere. However, Rhizobium presence has a significant effect on the number of tertiary roots, as well as the length of the primary and secondary roots. At the biomolecular scale, Rhizobium presence modulates the expression level of PsNPF6.4and PsNRT2.1-PsNAR2.1 genes involved in the nitrate signaling pathway, encoding for the nitrate High Affinity Transport System.","Numerous wireless communication devices operating in different frequency bands are deployed in the railway domain to answer the multitude of uses and needs, from control and command applications involving safety to non-critical applications (passenger information, video surveillance, on board TV, etc.). These applications are associated with quality of service (QOS) requirements that need estimation techniques and synchronization performance.These communications systems are based on standards that rely on two key technologies: OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) and MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output). The combination of MIMO and OFDM permits to benefit from the advantages of both methods. However, the orthogonality between subcarriers of OFDM-MIMO system is destroyed by inter-carrier interference caused by the Doppler effect and frequency offset and phase noise varying between oscillators at transmission and at reception. Thus, the performances of the techniques conventionally used for channel estimation and equalization in a static environment are considerably destroyed in the presence of interference between subcarriers.The purpose of this thesis is to develop new methods and algorithms for estimation and synchronization in very selective channel in time and frequency to allow the evolution of communication systems towards standards that will match better with high speed vehicular communications. It is important to distinguish the case where the propagation channel does not vary during the OFDM symbol duration and when it varies. In this thesis, we focused on the latter.We first developed an algorithm based on the Extended Kalman Filter and the QR decomposition for MIMO-OFDM transmissions. We first approximate the Expansion Model as a basis for temporal variations in complex gains. Our algorithm models the evolution of BEM coefficients within an OFDM symbol by an auto regressive model (AR). Then, we present a normalized frequency offset called normalized CFO in OFDM transmission system that introduces interference between carriers (IEP). This frequency offset is modeled by an AR model. Properties of Extended Kalman filter allow us to estimate simultaneously the two unknown variables, a vector of coefficients, the other BEM normalized frequency offset. The QR algorithm uses a detector to estimate the data symbols. This algorithm presented good performance for receivers at very high speeds. Our second contribution consists of an algorithm that uses the first algorithm to solve the IEP due to phase noise existing in the oscillator of the receiver, and the IEP due to the Doppler effect, but limited to SISO case. Here, we consider that the phase noise has a large variance within one OFDM symbol and also between the two following OFDM symbols. The phase noise is modeled by a Brownian process. Then, the Extended Kalman filter estimates the vector of coefficients of BEM and the vector of phase noise in OFDM symbols. This algorithm is very effective and has a remarkable BER performance when knowledge of the channel and phase noise is poor or nonexistent.","In the first part of this thesis, we provide a proof that any color Lie bialgebra can be quantized. This was proved for Lie bialgebras by Etingof and Kazhdan. Here we generalize this proof to color Lie bialgebras, which are Lie bialgebras graded by an arbitrary abelian group and symmetry given by a bicharacter. Before giving the details of the proof, we first recall the definitions and basic properties of color Lie algebras and bialgebras. Also a generalization of the Grand Crochet introduced by Lecomte and Roger to the color setting is given. Using the Grand Crochet, we also provide a cohomology for color Lie bialgebras. In the second part, we study different type of Hom-algebras, especially Hom-Lie and Hom-associative algebras. Hom-algebras are algebras were the defining relations, e.g. the associativity, are twisted by a linear map alpha called structure map. We first recall the relevant definitions. Then we define a new cohomology for Hom-associative and Hom-Lie algebras called alpha-type Hochschild and Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology respectively. We also show how these cohomologies can be used to study formal deformations, in the sense of Gerstenhaber, of Hom-associative and Hom-Lie algebras.  We allow  the deformation of the multiplication and the structure map.  We also consider alpha type cohomologies for Hom-bialgebras. Moreover, we explore the corresponding  homotopy Lie algebra structure  such that the Maurer-Cartan elements are Hom-algebras.","This thesis focuses on different aspects of \u201dLow Energy Design\u201d. First, reversible logic, as it is the first attempt for low energy computing, is briefly dis- cussed. Then, we focus on dynamic energy saving in the combinational part of CMOS circuits. We propose a new method to reduce glitches based on dual threshold voltage technique. Simulation results report more than 16% average glitch reduction. We also show that combining dual-threshold to gate-sizingtechnique is very interesting for glitch filtering as it brings up to 27 % energy savings. In the third part of this dissertation, we have been interested in sub-threshold operation where the minimum energy can be achieved using a reduced supply voltage. Sub-threshold operation has been an efficient solution for energy-constrained applications with low speed requirements. However, it is very sensitive to process variability which can impact the robustness and effective performance of the circuit. We propose a model valid in sub and near threshold regions in order to correctly estimate the circuit performance in a variability aware analysis. We provide an analytical solution for the optimum supply voltage that minimizes the total energy per operation while considering variability effects. Spice simulations matches the analytical result to within 6%.","The work conducted during this PhD falls within the general context of radar target detection using a non-conventional wideband waveform. More precisely, the use of a low-PRF wideband waveform has been proposed in the past as an alternative to the classical staggered-PRF processing used to mitigate velocity ambiguities that limits dwell time. Increasing the instantaneous bandwidth improves range resolution; fast moving targets are then likely to migrate during the coherent processing interval. This range-velocity coupling can then be used to mitigate velocity ambiguities. This PhD thesis aims at developing an algorithm able to provide unambiguous estimation of migrating targets using a low-PRF wideband waveform. It is based on a sparse representation algorithm able to unambiguously estimate migrating targets, within a Bayesian framework. However, this algorithm is developed under some hypothesis, and then requires robustification to be used on more realistic scenarii. First, the algorithm is robustified to the case of off-grid targets, and then upgraded to take into account a possible diffuse clutter component. On the other hand, the reference algorithm is modified to accurately estimate high dynamic range scenes where weak targets compete with strong targets. All the developed algorithms have been validated on synthetic and experimental data recorded by the PARSAX radar from the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands.","My research work was to identify experimentally and numerically the mechanical properties of the liver with Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) technique. The first in vitro part of this project was to develop a phantom mimicking the mechanical properties of the liver. Hyper-viscoelastic properties of the phantom were identified with compression tests, and MRE tests performed with a multifrequency protocol using a hepatic driver generating waves within the liver. In parallel to this experimental identification, a finite element analysis of the propagation of the wave was made through a simplified 2D model, composed of the phantom, with the boundary conditions of MRE test (amplitude of displacement of the membrane, frequency), subsequently with a 3D model. An inverse method was also developed to numerically characterize the elastic properties of the phantom. The results obtained experimentally and numerically were similar (\u03bc = 4 kPa), the identification process was validated and the phantom reveals the elastic properties of fibrotic liver tissue. The second in vivo part was focused on the study of the viscoelastic properties of healthy and fibrotic livers with multifrequency MRE tests. The elasticity increases with the stage of fibrosis. An analysis of the post-treatment (inversion algorithm, rheological models) showed different results of the viscosity with the stage of fibrosis. In addition, a 3D finite element model of the liver was reconstructed, with anatomical MRI slices, to simulate a MRE test and to analyze the behavior of the shear waves. These simulations enabled to adapt MRE protocols before the clinical phase.","In mammals, alternating between vigilance states requires some speci c processes that facilitate transitions between wake, Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS), and Paradoxical Sleep (PS). The objective of this thesis was to decipher, in mice, the neuronal mechanisms that control the alternation between these three vigilance states. During thus thesis, we first demonstrated using complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches that glucose can facilitate sleep induction by directly exciting sleep- promoting neurons located within the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). Then, by developing two different and complementary approaches, we contributed to clarify the physiological role of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons in sleep-wake regulation. Indeed, in addition to their PS-promoting effect when activated, we found that MCH neurons also contribute to the regulation of some aspects of SWS regulation by favouring the appearance of a deeper SWS and facilitating SWS episodes termination. These new results supporting a role of MCH neurons to SWS regulation led us to investigate a putative pathway underlying such an effect through efferent projections from MCH neurons to the VLPO. Preliminary results suggest that the optogenetic stimulation of axons from MCH neurons within the VLPO could facilitate the appearance of a transition state between SWS and PS without triggering PS onset","Sleep is a vigilance state observed in most of animal species and is involved in many functions. Paradoxical sleep (PS, or Rapid Eye Movement Sleep), an essential sleep state, seems to be closely linked to emotion regulation. It seems that one aspect of this function could be due to the potentiating role of PS in emotional long-term memory, and the paradoxical decrease in the emotional tone associated to the memorized event. We tested the hypothesis that the first hours of post-learning PS could be important for remote long term emotional memory in mice. We performed a contextual fear conditioning followed by 6 hours of PS deprivation, and assessed the memory at recent (24 hours) and remote (30 days) recall. Our behavioral analysis reveals a specific alteration of memory performances when animals were tested at remote delays, revealing for the first time a role of post-learning PS in remote memory consolidation.We then performed immunohistochemistry analysis of neuronal activation during memory recall by assessing the expression of the immediate early gene zif268 in a large number of areas involved in emotional memory processing. Our results reveal a major role of post-learning PS in the regulation of neuronal activity taking place during remote memory consolidation.Thus we show that the first few hours of post-learning PS can be crucial for the regulation  remote fear memory. These results suggest that this PS function could be due to the early initialization of remote reorganization of memory networks, acting notably by a homeostatic decrease of neuronal activity in areas involved in the expression of emotions","Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipids accumulation in medium and big size arteries, as the result of a complex series of mechanisms leading to chronic inflammation and accumulation of macrophage-derived foam cells in the intimal space of the vessels leading to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Rupture of the plaque can lead to life threatening events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Our scientific work is in the frame of the Gutenberg Health Study, a population based study in the region of Mainz in Germany, which goal is to identify new biological markers and therapeutic targets, with a particular focus on atherosclerosis. These previous studies have shown through transcriptomic analyses that a number of gene expression were correlated to both smoking and atherosclerosis, opening new perspective to better characterize mechanisms linking smoking to atherosclerosis. Among those genes SASH1, a tumor suppressor was the most correlated to smoking and was also correlated to plaques. Another gene of interest, SLC39A8 showed the strongest correlation to plaques. This thesis project aimed at exploring the role of the tumor suppressor SASH1 and the metallic ion transporter in vitro to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they could affect plaque formation during atherosclerosis...","Recently, the concept of angioneurins has emerged to define a molecule that can act on both the vascular and the nervous system. Angiopoietin-1 and -2, originally described as specific to the vascular bed and playing a major role during its setup, belong to this family. However, no data have been reported on the effect of Angiopoietins during neuronal network setup. In the present study, we highlight a role of Angiopoietins on embryonic cortical neurogenesis and particularly on radial migration of projection neurons, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of a neurovascular niche in the embryonic brain. Furthermore, we show a role of Angiopoietins in another step of neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, in an adult neuronal differentiation model, PC12 cells. We show that \u03b21 integrin, rather than Tie2, is involved in the neurotrophic effect of Angiopoietins. The understanding of the mechanisms linking the vascular and the neuronal networks is particularly important to propose new treatments for pathologies such as stroke. Indded, in this pathology, vascular insult leads to neuronal death and angiogenesis and neurogenesis occur concomitantly to allow tissue repair. We observed no effect of Angiopoietins on post-ischemic cellular reactions but a protective role of Ang2 in the acute phase of stroke that might partly be explained by a protection of the blood brain barrier from the ischemic insult. Taken together, our results yield new arguments to support that Angiopoietins belong to the family of angioneurins in physiological and pathological conditions. Accordingly, Angiopoietins might be potential therapeutic targets for cerebral pathologies.","Rare earth crisis in 2010 showed the importance of some materials and whipped up interest in the research on material criticality. A review work was first conducted in order to get a better understanding of the existing work in this research area and to see where more work is needed. Based on this review, three research gaps were identified (lack of a comprehensive diagnosis of criticality; lack of evaluation methodology at the product level; lack of links between the mechanism of criticality, the evaluation methodology and the solutions offered. This thesis focuses on the two first research gaps and offers several ideas for the last one. Regarding diagnosis of criticality, the mechanism is illustrated under four dimensions: imbalance between supply and demand, importance of the material to product, supply accessibility and dynamic factors. A definition of criticality is also put forward. Considering the established mechanism as research core, a methodology to evaluate the criticality of materials at the product level has been developed and is completed with a concrete and quantitative model. The methodology offers guidance on how to assess criticality and sets a framework for evaluation. The model illustrates a way to use this methodology through a tool that assigns a \u2018criticality score\u2019 to materials and shows how the score is contributed. The calculations were automated in Excel. Two applications, one for permanent magnet and the other for light emitting diode, were conducted to demonstrate and improve the methodology and the model","This thesis presents the study of four aspects of high energy astronomy.The first part of my thesis is dedicated to an aspect of instrument development for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, namely the Level 2 trigger system of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). My work on the project focused on the algorithm development and the Monte Carlo simulations of the trigger system and overall instrument (Moudden, Barnacka, Glicenstein et al. 2011a; Moudden, Venault, Barnacka et al. 2011b). The hardware implementation of the system is described andits expected performances are then evaluated. The H.E.S.S. array has been used to observe the blazar PKS 1510-089.The second part of my thesis deals with the data analysis and modeling of broad-band emission of this particular blazar. In part II of my thesis, I am presenting the analysis of the H.E.S.S. data: the light curve and spectrum of PKS 1510-089, together with the FERMI data and a collection of multi-wavelength data obtained with various instruments. I am presenting the model of PKS 1510-089 observations carried out during a flare recorded by H.E.S.S.. The model is based on a single zone internal shock scenario.The third part of my thesis deals with blazars observed by the FERMI-LAT, but from the point of view of other phenomena: a strong gravitational lensing. This part of my thesis shows the first evidence for gravitational lensing phenomena in high energy gamma-rays. This evidence comes from the observation of a gravitational lens system induced echo in the light curve of the distant blazar PKS 1830-211. Traditionalmethods for the estimation of time delays in gravitational lensing systems rely on the cross-correlation of the light curves from individual images. In my thesis, I used 300 MeV-30 GeV photons detected by the Fermi-LAT instrument. The FERMI-LAT instrument cannot separate the images of known lenses. The observed light curve is thus the superposition of individual image light curves. The FERMI-LAT instrument has the advantage of providing long, evenly spaced, time series with very low photonnoise. This allows to use directly Fourier transform methods. A time delay between the two compact images of PKS 1830-211 has been searchedfor both by the autocorrelation method and a new method: the \u201cdouble power spectrum\u201d. The double power spectrum shows a 4.2 \u03c3 evidence for a time delay of 27.1\u00b10.6 days (Barnacka et al. 2011), consistent with the results from Lovell et al. (1998) and Wiklind & Combes (2001).The last part of my thesis concentrates on another lensing phenomena called \u201dfemtolensing\u201d. The search for femtolensing effects has been used to derive limits on the primordial black holes abundance. The abundance of primordial black holes is currently significantly constrained in a wide range of masses. The weakest limits are established for the small mass objects, where the small intensity of the associated physical phenomenon provides a challenge for current experiments. I have usedgamma-ray bursts with known redshifts detected by the FERMI Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) to search for the femtolensing effects caused by compact objects. The lack of femtolensing detection in the GBM data provides new evidence that primordial black holes in the mass range 5 \u00d7 10^17 \u2013 10^20 g do not constitute a major fraction of dark matter (Barnacka et al. 2012). My Ph.D. studies have been carried out jointly between the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw in Poland and the IRFU institute of the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nergie atomique et aux \u00e9nergies alternatives(CEA) Saclay in France.","Hochschild homology was introduced by Gerhard Hochschild in 1945. It is an important invariant of an associative algebra over a field k. The definition extends from k-algebras to k-categories and further to differential graded (=dg) categories. Singularity categories were first introduced by Buchweitz in 1986 in an algebraic setting and rediscovered by Orlov in 2003 in a geometric setting. In this thesis, we study the Hochschild homology of the canonical differential graded categories which enhance the bounded derived category and the singularity category of a finite-dimensional algebra. One of our main results states that Hochschild homology of the dg enhanced singularity category is computed by the double Hochschild complex, which is spliced together from the classical Hochschild complex and its k-dual. We also report on applications of Hochschild and cyclic homology in the study of relative Calabi-Yau structures and relative Calabi-Yau completions following recent work by Brav-Dyckerhoff and Yeung.","The aim of this thesis work is to develop an IP-Library of FPGA-based embedded real-time simulator IPs (Intellectual Properties) that simulate different elements of an electrical system. These IPs have been designed to be used not only for Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) testing of digital controllers but also for low cost embedded control applications, where the simulator IP and the controller are both implemented and run altogether in the same FPGA device. This emerging class of real-time simulators is expected to be more and more included in the next generation of digital controllers. Indeed, such embedded real-time simulator IPs can be advantageously embedded within digital controllers to ensure functions like observation, estimation, diagnostic or health-monitoring. Conversely to the HIL case, the main challenge when designing such simulator IPs is to cope with their complexity having in mind that, in the case of embedded systems, the available hardware resources are limited due to the cost. Furthermore, this challenge is strengthened by the need of very short simulation time-steps which is typically the case when simulating power converters.To develop these IPs, dedicated design guidelines have been proposed to be followed to manage the complexity of these simulator IPs (model solver, numerical solver, time-step, data conditioning) with regards to the timing and the area\u002fcost constraints (computation time limit, limited hardware resources \u2026).The simulators IPs to be developed have been organized into two main categories: those dedicated to electromagnetic elements of an electrical system and those dedicated to their switching elements.The first category gathers elements where electric, magnetic phenomena are modelized in addition to mechanical phenomena (for moving systems) and potentially thermal phenomena. Three cases are dealt with: the embedded real-time simulator of a three-phase synchronous machine, the one of a three-phase induction machine and the one of a brushless synchronous generator. Also, the advantages of using delta transformation to improve the stability of the numerical solver when short simulation time-step and fixed-point (with limited data precision) are used, have been studied.The second category concerns switching elements such as power converters where switching events are considered. Here again, several converter topologies have been studied: a half-wave rectifier, a buck DC-DC converter, a bidirectional buck DC-DC converter, a H-bridge DC-DC converter, a single-phase H-bridge DC-AC converter, a three-phase voltage source inverter, a three-phase diode rectifier and a three-phase PWM rectifier. For all these IPs, the Associated Discrete Circuit (ADC) modeling approach is adopted.The embedded real-time simulator IP of the three-phase PWM rectifier has been applied in the context of an embedded application. The latter consists of a fault-tolerant control of a grid-connected voltage source rectifier. Thus, this simulator IP is associated with the one of a three-phase RL-filter and are both implemented within the rectifier controller to estimate the grid currents. These currents are injected in the controller in the case of a current sensor fault. The ability of this estimator to guarantee the service continuity in the case of faults is validated through HIL tests and experiments.","Seismic interferometry, like optic interferometry, studies the interferences phenomena between couples of seismic signals, with the aim of pointing at differences between those signals (Curtis et al. 2006 for instance). The data processing consists, generally, in correlating the recordings between different stations to retrieve the Green's function between these sensors (Derode et al. (2003), Wapenaar et al. (2004), Larose et al. (2006), Sanchez-Sesma et Campillo (2006)). This principle has already been successfully applied in the field of seismology (Campillo and Paul (2003)), ultrasound (Weaver et Lobkis (2001)), seismic exploration and even helioseismology (Duvall et al. (1993)). In all these cases, the analysis of the correlations leads to a detailed description of the propagation medium. Contrary to active seismic which uses artificial coherent sources (explosives, air guns\u2026), passive seismic exploits natural coherent sources (seisms\u2026). Since a few years, passive seismics also exploits random wave fields generated at unknown times by many unknown sources in the ground, and recorded at different stations positions. The analysis with cross-correlation of pairs of recordings, from pairs of sensors, leads to the Green's function between the two sensors (Derode et al. (2003)). This thesis has two objectives: -to check, at the lab scale, the effectiveness of monitoring of fluids substitution with noise correlation (ultrasound scale) in rocks -to apply noise correlation methods to passive seismic monitoring of a hydrocarbons field. This thesis presents, after a state of the art, the set-up of a new method to measure elastic constants of a rock sample (dry or fluid-saturated), based on ultrasound interferometry principle and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The method has been tested and validated (reproducibility, accuracy, precision\u2026) on a standard material (aluminium). We show that the effects of a fluids substitution are measurable on various rock samples (dry or saturated, with water or with ethylene glycol) with this method. Plus the results are in agreement with Biot-Gassmann's theory. Besides, several weaknesses of the method were pointed, that is to say the method does not work on heterogeneous or attenuating medium. The last part of this thesis exposes speed of waves variations in a hydrocarbons field, when steam is injected simultaneously inside the reservoir (enhanced oil recovery operation).","Medical compression therapy is recognized as an essential component in the treatment of venous diseases and is indispensable in the treatment of venous diseases at different stages of the disease (heavy legs, edema and ulcers). Although the benefit is recognized by the patients themselves and by physicians, there is at present little evidence to quantify this benefit. Against this background, the aim of this thesis is to provide more understanding and objectify the benefits of compression stockings (MCS) on in terms of physiology, neurophysiology and gait dynamics. Three areas of research were identified and studied. The first line of research is the study of the effect of compression on skin microcirculatory activity in the lower limbs using the Hematron ambulatory device. The results showed an improvement in skin blood flow activity for different classes of MCS and at different positions. These results would tend to challenge the widely accepted assumption that MCS improve venous return primarily by decreasing the cross-sectional area of (superficial or deep) veins. The second line of research involves the objectification of the improvement in the quality of life resulting from the wearing of MCS, usually this is expressed subjectively by people with venous disease. Preliminary results show that the analysis of heart rate variability highlights a relationship between the indicators of sympathovagal balance activity and the use of medical compression during the day. Given the wide dispersion in the results, this study should be carried out on a larger population to draw more reliable conclusions. The last line of research relates to the impact of MCS on the behavior and, in particular, the gait of the subject. Patients report that physical fatigue in the lower limbs is less prevalent at the end of the day with compression therapy. Our hypothesis is that the wearing of MCS has a direct impact on gait. To evaluate the kinetics of walking, we have designed, developed and validated an instrumentation involving accelerometers sensors. Preliminary tests have yielded relevant parameters characteristic of gait dynamics. The next step is to conduct an experimental campaign to objectify behavioral fatigue, with or without the wearing of medical compression, at the end of the afternoon.","Genotypic resistance mutations are a major concern for antiretroviral treatment optimisation in HIV-1 infected treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients. However, the analysis of the impact of genotypic mutations on treatment outcome is hampered by methodological issues such as the i) high number of possible mutations, ii) the potential collinearity between mutations, iii) the low number of patients included in those studies and iv) the definition of a virological endpoint. The objective of this thesis are 1) to give an overview and to discuss endpoints used in recent clinical trials in collaboration with European AIDS treatment network (NEAT) and those used in the context of drug resistance analysis, 2) to investigate the impact of genotypic resistance mutations on treatment outcome in treatment na\u00efve patients in a huge European collaboration EuroCoord-CHAIN and 3) to compare methods adapted for high-dimensional data in order to construct a genotypic score to predict treatment outcome in treatment experienced patients. We saw that most of the endpoints used in recent clinical trials are composite endpoints but pure virological outcomes should be used for the evaluation of drug resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance mutations impact on virological outcome of initial antiretroviral therapy if the treatment of the patient is not adapted to the viral genotype the patient is harbouring. Principal component analysis and partial least square showed a good performance but had only a slightly better predictive capacity for a virologal outcome compared to the genotypic score. We continue working on the comparison of these and other methods using different endpoints in the context of a collaboration with the Forum for collaborative HIV research.","Small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions are invaluable research tools, enabling a better understanding of regulatory mechanisms. In addition, protein interaction networks represent a relatively untapped, rich source of potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, it is likely that many inhibitors of protein interactions may also represent therapeutic candidates of interest. The discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of protein interactions has been generally considered as an arduous if not impossible task in the past century. However, in the past decade, it has become increasingly popular, partly thanks to the availability of a large arsenal of valuable screening methods. One of the objectives of the PhD work was to optimize a yeast BRET assay (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) previously developed in our lab. Although this work has not brought the expected optimization, it has provided a better understanding of the assay in yeast and it has suggested new avenues of optimization. The other objective was to discover small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction between CDK2, a protein kinase that plays a key role in cell division, and the CKS1 regulatory protein. CKS proteins interact with CDK1\u002f2-Cyclin complexes and play multiple roles in regulating the cell cycle and in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity. Two small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction CDK2\u002fCKS1 were identified by screening a chemical library, using a yeast two-hybrid assay. They have been confirmed by in vitro interaction assays and more active analogues have been identified.","Research developed in this thesis focused on the evaluation of Machine Learning algorithms through the Random Forest algorithm (RF). The evaluation of land for optimal crop production is nowadays done manually, which makes it long and prone to human error. Some Machine Learning algorithms (linear regression, discriminant factor analysis, k-nearest neighbours, naive Gaussian and Bayesian, support vector machines) were tested and evaluated on data sets. The RF algorithm has made it possible to develop a soil data classifier, and has made it possible to develop an expert without the involvement of a human expert in soil science. This approach can improve the land valuation process and provide valuable land evaluation. Two approaches to optimize RF performances have been developed. First, a non-deterministic algorithm was formulated to optimize execution time and accuracy. The results were compared to a classical deterministic research. Then, parallelization strategies for the construction of RF on GPUs was approved to reduce the learning time of such a classifier. Sequential version, parallel version and parallel version with large dynamic grain were studied, proposed and tested in solutions named seqRFGPU, parRFGPU and dpRFGPU respectively. The results show that seqRFGPGPU reduces execution times, with interesting average accelerations for parRFGPU and dpRFGPU. The development of the RF algorithm has historically led to the development of many libraries implementing this algorithm and its use on a wide variety of problems and datasets. Most RF implementations are based on an original idea proposed by L\u00e9o Breiman presented in 2001. A wide range of implementations has been introduced such as new data division approaches to improve performance and accuracy. The solutions for application to soil analysis, hyperparameter optimization and GPU parallelization are discussed in the full version of this thesis written in English.","The papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid malignancy. This tumour is associated with somatic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, due to gene rearrangements of the proto-RET. RET\u002fPTC1 rearrangement is the most common genetic alteration identified to date, it is formed by an intra chromosomic rearrangement which leads to the juxtaposition of the RET Tyrosine Kinase domain of the proto-RET with the gene H4. The fusion RET\u002fPTC1 oncogene represents an interesting target for small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategies since it is present only in the tumour cells and not in the surrounding normal cells. However, the biological efficacy of the siRNAs is hampered by their short plasma half-life due to poor stability in biological fluids and low intracellular penetration. In order to protect siRNA from degradation, and to improve their intracellular capture, we applied the concept of \u201csqualenoylation\u201d, ie. The bioconjugation of a drug substance to squalene, for the delivery of siRNA targeted toward the RET\u002fPTC1 fusion oncogene. The acyclic isoprenoid chain of squalene was covalently coupled with RET\u002fPTC1 siRNA at the 3\u2019-terminus of the sense strand via a stable thioether linkage. The linkage of RET\u002fPTC1 siRNA to squalene leads to an amphiphilic molecule that self-organise in water as RET\u002fPTC1 siRNA-SQ nanoassemblies of 170 nm and Zeta potential of -26.4 mV. These RET\u002fPTC1 siRNA-SQ NPs did not showed any cytotoxicity in vitro. Interestingly, in vivo, in a mouse xenografted RET\u002fPTC1 experimental model, RET\u002fPTC1 siRNA-SQ nanoparticles inhibited tumour growth, RET\u002fPTC1 oncogene and oncoprotein expression, after intravenous injections of 2.5 mg\u002fkg cumulative dose. In the last of this work, GALA-cholesterol combination with siRNA-SQ NPs further enhanced nucleic acid internalization, promoted their escape into the cytosol and consequently their gene silencing efficiency in vitro. In conclusion, these results showed that the \u201csqualenoylation\u201d offers a new non cationic plate-form for the siRNA delivery.","This thesis investigates the potential contributions of flexibilities in Low Voltage Smart Grids. These networks are intrinsically different than Medium and High Voltages networks, so that the control of LV flexibilities cannot be directly taken from MV and HV networks, and new methods should be developed. The contribution of these flexibilities is studied through two main benefits: improved network operation and peak shaving. The first benefit focuses on maintaining the critical variables within the admissible constraints. The objective is to manage the network closer to its limits, reducing the need for margins, and therefore the need for upscaling. This is especially true in case of significant insertion of distributed generations or electric vehicles. The studied flexibility is the coordinated management of decentralized generation (active and reactive powers, phase switch) and a tap changer. The second benefit concerns the reduction of the peak consumption, either at the transformer, either at the national level. The studied flexibility is the shedding of electric heating for a short time, followed by a rebound when the heating is turned back on.","To form a drop at the tip of a liquid column, a pinching process has to occur until it reaches the atomic scale at the final break-up, covering all length scales. Some recent experimental and theoretical results show that this common phenomenon is still poorly understood when the pinching reaches the thermal fluctuations length scales. Here, we try to deepen our understanding by using phase separated near-critical binary liquids as model of fluctuating liquids and interfaces and by looking at different relaxation dynamics of out of equilibrium situations: instability of a liquid column, interface relaxation and droplet evaporation. Hence, the study of these phenomena is performed using ultra-soft liquid interfaces and continuously varying hydrodynamic, thermodynamic and stochastic properties with the shift to the critical temperature. In a first step, the interface of these near-critical binary liquids is initially driven out of equilibrium using the radiation pressure of a laser wave in order to create in situ liquid columns and droplets. Dedicated tools for image analysis of near-critical fluctuating fluids were also developed. Then, we show that, contrary to the classical idea, liquid ligaments break-up triggered by Rayleigh-Plateau instability comes from modes superposition. This enables us, using Fourier analysis, to build the full dispersion relation for spontaneous break-up. Secondly, a preliminary work on drop spreading on solid surface established the existence of two dynamical regimes: one nonlinear relaxation mechanism to a spherical cap followed by an auto-similarity behavior of this spherical cap characteristic of Tanner\u2019s spreading. A significant amount of evaporation was also observed in some spreading dynamics, calling for a work extension considering  adapted models. A last study was performed on single droplet evaporation. It constitutes the first experimental work on conserved order parameter evaporation, furthermore for near-critical binary liquids. Against all odds, the measured evaporation and droplet rising dynamics seem completely unfit when using diffusion and gravity coupling descriptions. In particular, their behaviors are independent to the proximity to critical point. All these behaviors are verified over a large variation of distances to the critical point. As such, they seem to be universal within the criticality meaning. Eventually, the hydrodynamic behavior are verified when the thermodynamic one stay misunderstood. This raises questions on their coupling by means of thermal fluctuations. Nonetheless, thanks to the developed tools, we are now able to simultaneously get the macroscopic scale of the dynamics and the microscopic scale of interface fluctuations opening the way to more complete, multi-scale, analyses, in the fluctutations dominated case of the already observed phenomena.","It is increasingly common to see custom operators appear in various fields of circuit design. Custom operators that can be implemented in special hardware units make it possible to reduce code size, improve performance and reduce area. In this thesis, we propose a design flow based on custom operator identification for high-level synthesis. The key issues involved in the design flow are: automatic enumeration and selection of custom operators from a given high-level application code and re-generation of the source code incorporating the selected custom operators. Unlike the previously proposed approaches, our design flow is quite adaptable and is independent of high-level synthesis tools (i. E. , without modifying the scheduling and binding algorithms in high-level synthesis tools). Experimental results show that our approach achieves on average 19%, and up to 37% area reduction, compared to a traditional high-level synthesis. Meanwhile, the latency is reduced on average by 22%, and up to 59%. Furthermore, on average 74% and up to 81% code size reduction can be achieved.","A better understanding of the origin and evolution of the diversity of life requires the development of biogeographical approaches based on the phylogeography. This PhD thesis study considers the phylogeographical structure of the Common Myrtle (Myrtus communis L., Myrtaceae), a characteristic and common plant of the Mediterranean matorral, and its relationship with the Nivelle Myrtle (Myrtus nivellei Batt. & Trab.), endemic to the central Saharan mountains. An objective is also to examine especially the influence of palaeogeography and climatic changes on the genetic diversity of these two taxa. Our approach aims at being integrative, combining palaeobotanical data, genetic data (sequencing and multilocus genotyping), modeling of molecular evolution, polymorphism and heritability of the growth in controlled conditions, and modeling of bioclimatic niche. The analysis of 173 populations of the Common Myrtle and 23 populations of the Nivelle Myrtle reveals a strong phylogeographical signal, whose spatio-temporal framework was provided by the dating of divergences and the reconstruction of ancestral areas within the molecular phylogenies using Bayesian analytical methods. Three main results can be highlighted. (i) With an origin dated to the early Miocene, the history of M. communis can be summarized by two periods of diversification associated with the environmental changes occurring in the Miocene\u002fPliocene transition and in the Pleistocene. A vicariance phenomenon has induced the isolation of an eastern Mediterranean lineage. Recent diversification events have also been detected in the western part of the Mediterranean Basin, with in-return migration to the eastern Mediterranean, and also dispersal to the Azores and Madeira islands, and to the Sahara. (ii) Within the refugia-mountains of the Central Sahara, the alternation of wet and dry periods seems to have induced the isolation of the populations of M. nivellei per mountain range, with a strong genetic erosion. In parallel to this high regional differentiation, gene flows within these mountain ranges and vegetative multiplication have been detected. (iii) Finally, the absence of divergence of Mediterranean insular populations of M. communis contrasts with the long-term persistence of Myrtle lineages restricted to the Azores and Madeira islands, and to the speciation of M. nivellei in the Sahara. The discussion of these results provides new perspectives on comparative phylogeography, genomics and conservation biogeography.","During the financial and economic crisis of 2008, it was noticed that the amount of capital required for banks' trading portfolio was significantly less than the real losses. To understand the causes of this low capital requirement, it seemed important to estimate the reliability of the market risk models and to propose stress testing methodologies for the management of extreme risks. The objective is to measure the capital requirement on a trading portfolio, composed of shares and commodities by the measure of the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall. To achieve this goal, we use the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and two internal models commonly used by banks: historical simulation method and model of the normal law. A first evaluation of the reliability made on the three risk models under the hypothesis of constant volatility, shows that the internal banks' models and the GPD model do not measure correctly the risk of the portfolio during the crisis periods. However, GPD model is reliable in periods of low volatility but with a strong overestimation of the real risk; it can lead banks to block more capital requirement than necessary. A second evaluation of the reliability of the risk models was made under the hypothesis of the change of the volatility and by considering the asymmetric effect of the financial returns. GPD model is the most reliable of all, irrespective of market conditions. The performance of the internal banks' risk models improves when considering the change of the volatility. The integration of the historic and hypothetical scenarios in the risk models, improves the estimation of the extreme risk, while decreasing the subjectivity blamed to the stress testing techniques. The stress testing realized with the internal models of banks does not allow a correct measure of the extreme risk. GPD model is better adapted for the stress testing techniques. We developed an algorithm of stress testing which allow banks to estimate the extreme risk of their portfolios and to identify the risk factors causing this risk. The calculation of the capital requirement based on the sum of the VaR and the stress VaR is not logical and leads to doubling the capital requirement of banks. Consequently, it conducts to a credit crunch in the economy. We observe that the multiplier coefficient and the principle of square root of time of the Basel's agreement lead banks to make arbitration in favor of risk models that are not reliable.","Low-energy buildings benefit from a good thermal insulation and air tightness, associated with a smart integration of the building in its environment. Consequently, the required power for heating and cooling of the building is reduced to a great extent. This allows the use of conditioned ventilation air as the only energy vector: the air is supplied into the rooms at a low-velocity and with a low temperature difference with the indoor air. Air terminal devices are used, whose aim is to provide a homogeneous distribution of temperature and velocity inside of the rooms, and an efficient disposal of the indoor air pollutants. In this prospect, the thermal comfort and ventilation effectiveness in a test room (scale 1) resulting from an integrated heating, cooling and ventilation system is assessed both experimentally and numerically. The air is supplied close to the ceiling through a wall-mounted diffuser of complex geometry composed of twelve lobed nozzles, and the occupancy is modeled by two cylindrical manikins releasing sensible heat and carbon dioxide. Experimentally, the air velocity, CO2 concentration, indoor air, wall and black globe temperatures are monitored in order to assess the Predicted Mean Vote and draught rate in the occupied zone as well as the ventilation efficiency. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are then performed in order to provide valuable information on the airflow patterns in the room. The air diffuser\u2019s geometry being too complex for a direct simulation, a two-step modeling approach is adopted in order to take it into account in the simulations and to accurately represent the heat and mass transfers in the room. Furthermore, parametric studies are performed in order to investigate the influence of the supplying conditions and the internal heat gains on the airflow and on the resulting comfort, for particular conditions corresponding to those of low-energy buildings.","Cutaneous melanoma remains one of the most challenging and difficult cancers to treat because of its high plasticity, metastatic potential and resistance to treatment. New therapies targeting oncogenic BRAFV600E mutation have shown remarkable clinical efficacy. However, drug resistance invariably develops. Thus, the need for improving existing therapies remains critical. Recent studies have indicated that tumor resistance arises from the tumor microenvironment in which the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a determinant factor. Here, we found that BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-resistant melanoma cells, but not BRAFi-sensitive cells display an increased mechanosensitivity associated with a capacity to produce and remodel a 3D ECM displaying increased levels of matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN) and collagen fibers. Interestingly, our results show that this 3D ECM is able to protect therapy-sensitive cells from the anti-proliferative effects of MAPKi. In addition, short exposures of naive melanoma cells to MAPKi augment matrix proteins production and assembly in vitro and in vivo. This 3D ECM also promotes drug tolerance within BRAFi sensitive cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that a subset of resistance to MAPK targeted therapies is associated with the production by melanoma cells of a pathological fibrotic matrisome that may affect cell behavior and therapeutic response.","A thorough investigation on the influence of several metallurgical defects on the hydrogen diffusion and trapping was conducted on nickel. This work was conducted towards two scientific orientations. A first approach was to assess the impact of intrinsic defects, especially grain boundaries and geometrically necessary dislocations on the hydrogen transport and segregation mechanisms. Combining microstructural characterizations with electrochemical permeation tests and thermal desorption spectroscopy, it has established that the grain boundaries with ordered structure called \"special grain boundaries\" are preferential areas for hydrogen segregation. On the other hand, a second category of grain boundaries called \"general\" or \"random\" with high free volume and disordered structure are promoters for hydrogen diffusion, and they represent the main sources of the phenomena short-circuit diffusion reported in the face-centered cubic materials. The second approach of this work consisted in the study of the interaction of hydrogen with the plastic deformation heterogeneities. The electrochemical permeation tests performed on microstructures obtained by deformation showed that for the traction monotonous, the equiaxed cells and walls of dislocations are the potential traps for hydrogen and they slow its transport, this latter is mainly provided by the interstitial diffusion mechanism. In addition, for fatigue microstructure, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen was recorded, and suggesting that a phenomenon similar to short-circuit diffusion is involved in the transport of hydrogen. On two approaches, the results suggest a contribution of hydrogen in the formation of vacancies","Due to the large diffusion of P2P applications and especially P2P live-streaming, P2P traffic occupies an extremely large portion of overall Internet traffic. In this context, this thesis proposes new instruments to measure, identify and control P2P traffic. Regarding traffic classification, since traditional techniques have a hard time identifying P2P traffic, we propose a new behavioral classifier, Abacus, tailored for P2P live-streaming. Our experiments prove that Abacus, though based on simple counts of packets and bytes exchanged by a host, represents a lightweight and accurate solution for identifying P2P applications. Second, since the huge volume of traffic obliges operators to employ either flow-level monitors (e. G. NetFlow) or packet sampling to cut down the amount of measurement data, we evaluate the impact of data reduction on traffic characterization and classification. We show that Abacus can be adapted to this kind of data, suffering only a minor loss in accuracy and statistical classification remains possible if training and validation data are sampled at the same rate, in spite of the distortion introduced by packet sampling. Finally, we study a new transport protocol for P2P traffic, LEDBAT (Low Extra Delay Background Transport Protocol), the congestion control algorithm of the official BitTorrent client. This delay-based algorithm aims to provide an efficient, lower-than-best-effort service. Though faithful to its goals, the original design of LEDBAT appears affected by a latecomer advantage: we identify the main cause of the unfairness and propose effectives correction that restore the fairness.","This thesis addresses the design and implementationof a programming language for real-time streaming applications,such as video decoding. The model of Kahnprocess networks is a natural fit for this area and hasbeen used extensively. In this model, a program consistsin a set of parallel processes communicating via singlereader, single writer queues. The strength of the modellies in its determinism.Synchronous functional languages such as Lustre arededicated to critical embedded systems. A Lustre programdefines a synchronous Kahn process network, thatis, which can be executed using finite queues and withoutdeadlocks. This is enforced by a dedicated type system,the clock calculus, which establishes a global timescale throughout a program. The global time scale isused to define clocks: per-queue boolean sequences indicating,for each time step, whether a process producesor consumes a token in the queue. This information isused both for enforcing synchrony and for generatingfinite-state software or hardware.We propose and study integer clocks, a generalizationof boolean clocks featuring arbitrarily big natural numbers.Integer clocks model the production or consumptionof several values from the same queue in the courseof a time step. We then rely on integer clocks to definethe local time scale construction, which may hide timesteps performed by a sub-program from the surroundingcontext.These principles are integrated into a clock calculus fora higher-order functional language. We study its properties,proving among other results that well-typed programsdo not deadlock. We adjust the clock-directedcode generation scheme of Lustre to generate finite-statedigital synchronous circuits from typed programs. Thetyping information controls certain trade-offs betweentime and space in the generated circuits.","An increase in atmospheric CO2 levels has been observed since the beginning of the industrial era, which had a major impact on crops yield. Increase atmospheric CO2 concentration has been identified as a fertilizing agent that induces an alteration of the nutritional quality of plants. A decrease in proteins and minerals content has been observed. Such variation in nutritional value of crops might conduct to the development of metabolic disorders and the disruption of antioxidant and antiinflammatory defense leading to the increased incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as \"metabolic syndrome\".The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on the nutritional and health quality of two types of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum): MicroTom, a dwarf variety that has been extensively studied as model plant and the big tomatoes represented by the parents of the MAGIC population (that resumes the genetic diversity existing in cultivated tomatoes). The determination of macronutrients such as sugars, lipids and proteins followed by the quantification of micronutrients such as carotenoids and minerals allowed us to establish a complete nutritional profile confirming the degradation of the mineral and protein composition accompanied by an accumulation of sugars and a modification of bioactive compounds. A more profound investigation was the evaluation of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity on tomato extracts to better understand the influence of this modification on human nutrition and biological defenses. Our results highlighted that the MicroTom model showed a marked modification of its biochemical profile. The study of antioxidant activity on this model revealed an alteration that can be explained by the interaction between culture conditions and atmospheric CO2 enrichment while the anti-inflammatory activity seems to be unchanged.The second MAGIC model confirmed the results obtained with MicroTom, thus it validated that an alteration of the biochemical composition of the tomato did not show a negative effect on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defense. All these observations on MicroTom and MAGIC allowed us to make the link between the atmospheric CO2 enrichment and human health and to give suggestions to better orient future research in this field.","Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Although early management is of good prognosis, the survival of patients decrease dramatically for metastatic stages. Despite the recent spectacular therapeutic advances, the major problem lies in resistance to treatment and relapse and the main challenge now is to develop an effective and sustainable control. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have the ability to specifically target and eliminate tumor cells while recruiting cells from the immune system, to develop and \u002f or enhance the immunity of the host with the development of a vaccinal immune response. In a solid tumor model of murine melanoma after subcutaneous transplantation of B16F10 cells, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of TA99 mAb targeting a TYRP-1 surface antigen overexpressed in tumor melanocytes. Our results showed that about 30% of mice are protected in the long term and have an antitumoral humoral and cellular immune response. Moreover, the analysis of the immune infiltrate in mice that escape to the treatment with TA99 mAb and develop a tumor, shows an overexpression of PD-1 and Tim3 associated with a loss of effector cell functions within the tumor. This same phenotype has been observed in biopsies of patients with metastatic melanoma. Thus, blocking the PD-1 \u002f PDL-1 axis by inoculation of an anti-PD1 mAb at the time of tumor escape potentiates the anti-tumor immune response and results in increased survival. However, the absence of complete regression suggests the establishment of other immunosuppressive pathways. Indeed we have observed an overexpression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases in the tumor microenvironment suggesting the involvement of adenosine in the resistance mechanisms observed and opening interesting perspectives for the concomitant blocking of this pathway and the PD1 \u002f PDL-1 axis. Another strategy has been to improve the early immunomodulatory effects of TA99 mAb by combining it with oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy that promotes immunogenic death. Although the therapeutic combinations tested in this study showed encouraging in vivo effects with a significant delay in overall survival, no significant increase in the long-term anti-tumor response was observed, suggesting the establishment of other non-redundant immunosuppressive mechanisms or unsuitable combinations strategies. Both phenotypic and functional analysis of the different cellular actors of the tumor microenvironment will be a key step in the implementation of relevant combinations in association with the TA99 mAb. This work is highlighted by a phase I clinical trial (IMC-20D7S) using flanvotumab (human equivalent of mAb TA99) in 27 patients with metastatic melanoma that shows interesting clinical outcome without severe side effects, opening the way for the development of therapeutic combinations associated with this mAb.","The fault diagnosis in automatic systems is to trace perceived symptoms to causes. Most of model-based methods are based on the concept of analytical redundancy. The analytical redundancy relations are equations derived from an analytical model, which admits as input only the measured variables. Other classes of model-based methods are based directly on the parameter estimate. The modern syntheses of residuals generation require very detailed knowledge of system to control or to diagnose. Writing the most accurate models require a deep understanding of mechanisms and uses law of physics. The models obtained this way are called knowledge-based models. They involve physical parameters which, by definition, are measurable by experiments which are not necessarily related to how to use the system. However, in some practical cases, these parameters can be evaluated a priori. Moreover, the reliability provided by the knowledge-based models is usually accompanied by the disadvantage of excessive complexity. These models may not be used in practice and we must often reduce the complexity. This work contributes to develop a new algebraic and deterministic approach of fault diagnosis, which is not based on an a priori explicit model of the process and presents a new perspective based on the theory of distributions and the pseudospectra analysis of matrix pencils. Our approach is based on certain tools and developments in the theory of algebraic estimation usual in automatic community but very unconventional in signal processing","New needs in the field of global scale Internet by satellite have led the industry to focus on the manufacturing of thousands of satellites by setting up automatic design and calibration chains. Computer-aided post-fabrication tuning is used in this technology to adapt and improve the frequency performance of microwave filters before satellites are launched into orbit. This thesis focuses on the development of generic and automated tuning procedures for microwave filters manufactured by different technologies (additive manufacturing, cavity filters, planar filters) and more particularly in the creation of standardized procedures and models accompanying the optimization and tuning of tunable filters. The final goal is to implement and validate on practical cases these software tools in order to proceed to the application of these concepts and proven tuning procedures on robotized systems or on the dynamic control of tunable filters. In a first step, the present manuscript addresses the general context on which the entirety of this thesis work is based and focuses on the state of the art of the post automatic tuning procedures presented in the scientific literature. In a second part, studies are presented on the automatic post-tuning of volume filters of various specifications and coupling topologies. The last part presents the computer-aided tuning of a volume filter and a tunable planar filter.","This thesis deals the quiet design by inverses approaches of synchronous machines with permanent magnets concentrated windings. Our work focuses on the analysis of magnetic noise origin of air gap radial force orders. Firstly a direct electromagnetic model allowed us to determine the spatio-temporal spectrum of air gap radial pressure. The latter offers us the possibility of obtaining step by step and in an analytical way the radial induction in the gap, result of the product of the total magnetomotive force and global air gap permeance. Several machines equipped with a concentrated winding and distributed were evaluated, compared to simulations by finite elements and corroborated by an operational deflection shape on an existing prototype in the laboratory. In the second time two inverse approaches named predictive methodology identified the radial pressure low order origin. Finally, the resolution of the inverse problem is carried out by means of an iterative optimization loop giving among a sample of solutions, a winding function, aimed at attenuating or eliminating a potential risky line in terms of acoustic nuisances.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease characterized by the loss oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Despite recent advances leading to stop the immune system from attacking oligodendrocytes, efficient remyelinating therapies are still lacking. In MS, there is a spontaneous remyelination attempt from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) present all over the brain, but this phenomenon is inefficient and diminishes with age. The observation that OPCs are present within demyelinating MS lesions, but fail to differentiate into myelinating cells, suggests that induction of OPC differentiation is a critical event for successful remyelination. This work has aimed to characterize a novel regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, Tensin 3 (Tns3).  Here we demonstrate that Tns3 actin binding protein is a regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, acting downstream of Ascl1 and Olig2, two key oligodendrogenic transcription factors. We show that Tns3 expression is strongly induced at the onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation, while downregulated in mature oligodendrocytes. Tns3 is therefore a novel specific marker of differentiating oligodendrocytes. Using demyelinating mouse models, we provide evidence that Tns3 expression characterizes newly differentiating oligodendrocytes within remyelinating areas and may thus be used as a hallmark for remyelination in MS lesions. We also found that Tns3 protein is mainly localized in the nucleus of neural cells, contrary to its cytoplasmic expression outside the CNS, suggesting a neural specific function beyond its role in cell adhesion junctions. Finally, developing CRISPR\u002fCas9 genome editing techniques in our lab, we demonstrate that Tns3 loss-of-function in neonatal neural stem cells (NSCs) strongly impairs oligodendrocyte differentiation in vivo. Therefore, Tns3 is a novel factor involved in the control of oligodendrocyte differentiation and a hallmark for differentiating oligodendrocytes during development and in remyelinating lesions of the adult brain. We expect that our in deep characterization of Tns3 mechanism of action will help to develop therapeutic strategies fostering oligodendrocyte differentiation, and therefore remyelination and functional repair in MS patients.","This thesis is dedicated to the development of a multi-scale approach for the simulation of the deep silicon etching under Bosch process. The project has been done under CIFRE contract between the Institut des Mat\u00e9riaux Jean Rouxel and STMicroelectronics Tours. This multi-scale approach is composed of three modules allowing the study of the time and space evolution of the etched silicon profile. The first module is a plasma kinetic model. It calculates the densities and fluxes of the species taken into account in the reaction scheme. This model is applied to the SF6\u002fO2\u002fAr and C4F8 plasma mixtures. The second module is based on the Monte-Carlo technique and allows the calculation of the energy and angular distribution functions of positive ions through the sheath. The fluxes of the chemically reactive species and the ion distributions calculated by those two modules are then injected as input parameters in the etching module. The latter is based on a cellular Monte-Carlo approach allowing the description of the time and space evolution of the etched profiles, their chemical composition along the surface and the etching rate. Such techniques are used to predict the etched profile evolution under Bosch process as a function of machine parameters. The influence of the machine parameters on the plasma kinetic, sheath dynamic and profile evolution has been studied. Good agreements between the simulations from the kinetic model and the experiment have been shown. On the other side, The simulated profiles are promising before the model calibration.","In the automotive industry, rolled steels are widely used to produce constituent parts of a car. The high cycles fatigue properties of these flat steel are usually determined in a virgin state of the  material (i.e., without preliminary loading) under uniaxial cyclic loading with a constant stress amplitude. However, production of structural parts mostly involves some forming processes that have for consequence to modify the material state and thus to impact the fatigue properties. Furthermore, operational loads condition actually incurred by such a part is often multiaxial and with variable amplitude. The aim of this study is to take into account multiaxial and load history aspects in the fatigue characterization by means of self-heating measurements under cyclic loading. Multiaxial fatigue characterization usually involves a fatigue criterion that required the endurance limit of the material under a shear loading. But this limit is difficult to obtain for flat steel. That why a new shear test and two new disk-shaped specimens were proposed, permitting the use of self-heating measurements. Thus, the endurance limit of the material under a shear loading was determined. In order to study the impact of load history effects on fatigue properties, various self-heating tests were performed considering several initial pre-straining levels, several cyclic pre-loading and several load ratios. From these results, a new probabilistic two-scale model was proposed capable of describes selfheating curves with any load history considered and provides a reliable estimation of these load history effects on S-N-P curves.","Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) progression involves enlargement of lymph nodes due to an accumulation of CLL B cells into the nodal microenvironment. The crucial role of the antigenic stimulation through the B cell receptor (BCR) in normal B cell trafficking into the lymph nodes suggests that BCR engagement might be implicated in the CLL B cell retention\u002faccumulation into the lymphatic compartment. In this context, we focused our efforts on the study of the impact of an in vitro antigenic stimulation on the expression of key effectors involved in CLL B trafficking. First, we demonstrated that BCR stimulation decreased CXCR4- and CD62L-membrane expressions; this decrease was associated to an in vitro reduction of CLL B cell migration and adhesion. Moreover, the intensity of CXCR4- and CD62L- down-regulation upon BCR stimulation was linked to unfavourable prognostic markers and correlated to CLL patients\u2019 progression free survival. Next, we analysed the activated BCR signalling cascades that were involved in CXCR4 internalization of CLL B cells. The LY294002\u002fCAL101-PI3K and G\u00f66976\u002fCID755673-PKD inhibitors blocked BCR-dependent CXCR4 down-regulation, revealing the role of the PKDs in this process. Functionally, BCR triggering induced PKD2\u002f3 phosphorylation\u002factivation in a PI3K-dependent manner. Interestingly, the level of the phospho-PKD2\u002f3 induction was correlated to the intensity of BCR-dependent CXCR4 down-regulation. Furthermore, BCR engagement allowed CXCR4 phosphorylation on specific residues involved in its internalization, suggesting that CXCR4 endocytic process was partially regulated by PKDs. Altogether, our results demonstrated the PI3K and PKD implications on cell surface CXCR4 downregulation in response to BCR stimulation. These data proposed that PI3K and PKDs could play a role in the altered lymphatic trafficking of CLL B cells upon BCR engagement.","Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, however optimal dosages are not yet well defined. The aim of this thesis was to develop pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics (PK\u002fPD) models that characterize the course of antimicrobial drug concentrations and effects over time, with an emphasis on the development of resistance. These models were applied to optimize dosing regimens of antimicrobial therapies.\u003cbr\u002f\u003eA population PK model for colistin and its prodrug, colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) was developed in critically ill patients receiving colistin by nebulization and\u002for undergoing an intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Results predicted clear bene\ufb01ts of using aerosol delivery of 2MIU CMS dose for the treatment of pulmonary infections. For patients with HD session dosing regimen of CMS should be 1.5 MIU twice daily with an additional dose of 1.5 MIU after each HD session.\u003cbr\u002f\u003eAn assessment of the performances of different PK-PD models by using a simulation approach have shown the importance of longer study designs and of complementary microbiological data to predict accurately bacterial resistance development.\u003cbr\u002f\u003e A semi-mechanistic PK\u002fPD model that incorporates mutation rate and adaptive resistance development of a bioluminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against colistin was developed based on in-vitro data. A high, quick and partially reversible resistance was described. These results confirm that the first 24 h of treatment are critical in the management of infections, that colistin alone cannot eradicate completely the mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were selected during the experiments and that combination therapies seem necessary.","Computers are without doubt one of the most important invention of the last century, whose impact cannot be overestimated. Over the years they became powerfull, due to the constant optimization of their processors. With the growing need of computing power due to AI, processors have become faster then ever. However, since we are reaching the power wall, Moore\u2019s law is coming to an end. Therefore, a young research community called rebooting computing is looking for alternative computation architectures. In this work, we propose to use stochastic computing to build architectures dedicated to Bayesian inference aiming low-power consumption. We develop two machines, namely the Bayesian machine (BM) and the Bayesian sampling machine (BSM). In this thesis, we look at two signal processing applications: Sound Source Localization (SSL) and Source Separation (SS). For SSL, we introduce three methods using the BM. The first one is working in the time-frequency domain and hence uses the Fourier transform. The second one is running entirely in the temporal domain. The third one is a multi-source localization approach based on the previous method. We present a technique to speed up the stochastic computation by a factor of up to 10 3 . Moreover, we designed an on-chip likelihoods computation mechanism to reduce the memory needs of our machine. Furthermore, we ran simulations and real world experiments to validate our methods. We made ASIC simulations to evaluate the power consumption. For the second problem, the source separation, we introduce a more general machine, the Bayesian sampling machine, which is based on the Gibbs sampling approach. We present a sampling method to solve source separation and run simulations to show the effectiveness of this technique.","Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles carrying macromolecules that can influence host-pathogen interactions. The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (SA) releases EVs whose characteristics are still largely explored. This thesis\u2019s project provides the first work extensively characterizing the RNA and protein content of profile of SA clinical HG003 strain and its producing cells. We found that EVs comprised all RNA classes including small regulatory RNA. The protein content of EVs was also diverse with various important elements such as virulence factors, transcriptional regulators, and metabolic enzymes. Interestingly, the protein and RNA content of EVs differed from that of its producing cells, suggesting that selective cargo packing exists. The intra- and interspecies role of EVs was also investigated.We found that the addition of HG003 EVs to bacterial cultures improved their growth in restrictive media. In the context of host-pathogen interactions, the cellular response induced by EVs differed from that induced by the living bacteria in both human and bovine models, indicating that EVs could display other physiological functions than those of bacteria which may be important to the infection process. Overall, our data evidence that SA EVs carry important newly discovered elements, and modulate the host response with different intensities, exposure periods, and by different routes from that of live bacteria. This study brings new knowledge about SA EVs potential functional roles in the context of bacterial physiology and staphylococcal infections.","Over the last decade, a new multidisciplinary research domain named Social Signal Processing (SSP) emerged. It is aimed at enabling machines to sense, recognize, and display human social signals. One of the challenging tasks addressed by SSP is the automated group interaction analysis. Recently, a particular emphasis is given to the automated study of emergent states as they play an important role in group dynamics. These are social processes that develop throughout group members' interactions.In this Thesis, we address the automated analysis of cohesion in small groups interactions. Cohesion is a multidimensional affective emergent state that can be defined as a dynamic process reflected by the tendency of a group to stick together to pursue goals and\u002for affective needs. Despite the rich literature available on cohesion from a Social Sciences perspective, its automated analysis is still in its infancy. Grounding on Social Sciences' insights, this Thesis aims to develop computational models of cohesion following four axes research axes, leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. Computational models of cohesion, indeed, should account for the temporal nature of cohesion, the multidimensionality of this group process, take into account how to model cohesion from both individuals and group perspectives, integrate the relationships between its dimensions and their development over time, and take heed of the relationships between cohesion and other group processes.In addition, facing a lack of publicly available data, this Thesis contributed to the collection of a multimodal dataset specifically designed for studying group cohesion and for explicitly controlling its variations over time. Such a dataset enables, among other perspectives, further development of computational models integrating the perceived cohesion from group members and\u002for external points of view. Our results show the relevance of leveraging Social Sciences' insights to develop new computational models of cohesion and confirm the benefits of exploring each of the four research axes.","Free space perception, without any prior knowledge, is still a challenging issue in mobile robotics. In this thesis, we propose to use active contour models and monocular omnidirectional vision as a framework within which to realize real-time unknown free space detections. Several approaches have been developed in the literature and can be classified in two main categories : Parametric and Geometric active contours. The parametric active contours are explicit models whose deformation is constrained by minimization of a functional energy. These latters provide fast segmentations but can not ensure the convergence of the contour to boundary concavities. In contrast, the geometric methods consider an implicit representation of the contour as the level sets of two dimensional distance functions which evolve according to an Eulerian formulation. They overcome contour convergence in boundary concavities and allow to automatically handle topology changes of the contour. However, their use is limited because of their prohibitive computational cost. In this work, various improvements to existing geometric and parametric models have been proposed to overcome these constraints of prohibitive computational cost and poorly convergence to boundary concavities. A new method based on an Bezier curves interpolation with a geometric construction is proposed. Experiments led in real environments have validated the interest and efficiency of these approaches.","Somatosensory input from distinct face regions is relayed through the trigeminal circuit and serially wired to the brainstem, thalamus and cortex. In the mouse, a large portion of the face representation in the brain is devoted to the whiskers. Sensory inputs from individual whiskers are relayed and somatotopically mapped at each level of the brain pathway as spatially ordered sets of whisker-related neuronal modules, generating point-to-point connectivity maps. Little is still known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation of such brain whisker-related patterns. Here, we find that the trigeminal nerve maxillary branch generates a topographic map of whisker-related trigeminal primary afferent connectivity in brainstem nuclei from prenatal stages. We further show that in Edn1 mutant mice, which display an ectopic whisker pad in place of the lower jaw, mandibular primary trigeminal neurons acquire maxillary-like molecular features upon innervation of the ectopic whisker arrays. Nonetheless, despite these molecular changes, the presence of an ectopic whisker pad is not sufficient to impose ectopic whisker-related patterns in brainstem target nuclei. Conversely, we show that Hoxb2 expression in the developing brainstem principal trigeminal nucleus is required to establish precise row- and whisker-related topography of primary afferent targeting and barrelette pattern. These results provide novel and unanticipated insights into the relative importance of intrinsic patterning mechanisms at brainstem level versus facial peripheral inputs in the building of a cerebral somatosensory map.","Data centers, factories housing thousands of computer servers that work permanently to exchange, store, process data and make it accessible via the Internet. With the digital sector development, their energy consumption, which is largely fossil fuel-based, has grown continuously over the last decade, posing a real threat to the environment. The use of renewable energy is a promising way to limit the ecological footprint of data centers. Nevertheless, the intermittent nature of these sources hinders their integration into a system requiring a high reliability degree. The hybridization of several technologies for green electricity production, coupled with storage devices, is currently an effective solution to this problem. As a result, this research work studies a multi-source system, integrating tidal turbines, photovoltaic panels, batteries and a hydrogen storage system to power an MW-scale data center. The main objective of this thesis is the optimization of a data center power supply, both for isolated sites and grid-connected ones. The first axis of this work is the modeling of the system components using the energetic macroscopic representation (EMR). Energy management strategy based on the frequency separation principle is first adopted to share power between storage devices with different dynamic characteristics. The second axis concerns the optimal sizing of the proposed system, in order to find the best configuration that meets the technical constraints imposed at minimum cost, using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Here, a rules-based energy management technique is used for simplicity and reduced computing time purposes. The last axis focuses on the energy management optimization through GA, taking into account the storage systems degradation in order to reduce their operating costs and extend their lifetime. It should be noted that each axis previously discussed has been the subject of a specific sensitivity analysis, which aims to evaluate the performance of the hybrid system under different operating conditions.","Forensic sciences can be defined as the used of technical processes to judicial investigations allowing the scientific study of traces and evidences found on crime scenes.Since the discovery of DNA fingerprinting by Sir Alec Jeffreys in 1984, the legal world has become deeply rooted in the DNA by successive technological developments in molecular biology and its applications in forensic. The need for instant response is omnipresent in the minds. The key to success is the implementation of simple, sensitive, reliable analytical techniques that enable results to be achieved in the shortest possible time.During these technical processes, the collection of biological samples, is an unavoidable and a crucial step that will condition the analysis success rate. This study consisted in developing efficient biological collecting solutions either by diverting from their original function the existing solutions or by developing simple but innovative solutions combining the advantages of the existing solutions. This allowed developing the micro-swab GendSAG. The potentialities of GendSAG make it possible to propose an alternative solution to the commercial rapid DNA analysis integrated systems. This rapid, cost effective and high-throughput DNA analysis solution performed in a dedicated mobile laboratory directly into the crime scene enables the large majority of the rapid DNA analysis integrated systems benefits and also all of their limitations.","This thesis consists of a mutual approach of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology to assess the drug interactions between Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and antihypertensives, as close as possible of primary care. The French pharmacovigilance database and the French health insurance system database have been used. The pharmacovigilance approach has showed that patients exposed to these drug interactions had similar characteristics with hypertensive patients in general population. This study underlined the important risk of acute renal failure caused by drug interactions between NSAIDs and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs), Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Diuretics (phenomenon called triple whammy). The pharmacoepidemiological approach showed that increase in arterial blood pressure caused by drug interactions between NSAIDs and antihypertensives led to a greater risk of antihypertensive treatment intensification (Relative Risk for NSAIDs exposure: 1. 34 [1,05-1,71]) in general population. This study underlined the specific risk of NSAIDs interactions with ACEis and\u002for ARBs. The second pharmacoepidemiological study showed an insufficiently secure initiation of NSAIDs among treated hypertensive patients. Recommended laboratory monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium were only applied in 10. 7% of cases. These insufficiencies were more frequent in general practitioners than other prescribers (cardiologists or anesthesiologists). Drug interactions between NSAIDs and antihypertensives, although fully described, have a major impact in primary care.","Cholesterol (CH) level management is a keystone to limit cardiovascular diseases. The contrasted efficiency of the drugs currently available as well as the interest around the intestinal microbiota in regulating the host physiology lead us to consider this pathway as a therapeutic alternative. The production of coprostanol (CO), a very poorly absorbed CH derivative, by bacteria of this microbiota has been positively correlated with low CH plasma level. The aims of this thesis are (i) isolate and identify new bacterial strains possessing this activity, (ii) identify the bacterial genes responsible for this transformation and (iii) determine the impact of this metabolism on host physiology. We isolated 22 new strains producing CO from the stools of a high-coprostanol producing individual. We chose Bacteroides sp. D8 and Bacteroides sp. BV for the construction of two genomic libraries and eight others for in vivo implantation tests in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of germ-free mice. We identified 55 potentially positive clones by functional screening of these genomic libraries. Their additional analyzes should provide us with information about the genes involved in this activity. All selected bacteria are capable of colonizing the GIT of germ-free mice. Parabacteroides distasonis is the best strain producing CO in vivo. We tested its effect on blood cholesterol level in germ-free mice subjected to an 11-week CH-rich diet compared to an in vitro non-producing strain, B. dorei, and with conventionalized mice as control. The B. dorei strain produces CO in vivo, emphasizing the importance of the environment in the CO production activity already assumed from the literature and our results in vitro. Genes involved in the excretion of CH from body to feces are overexpressed in these mice and those colonized with P. distasonis. However, only the latter have lower cholesterolemia than conventional mice. The mechanism involved appears to be independent of CO production and CH excretion because the same amounts of these compounds are found in feces independently of bacterial status. Total biliary acids concentrations in bile and feces are higher for monocolonized mice compared to conventionalized mice. The feces of mice colonized with P. distasonis exhibited more urso- and chenodeoxycholic acids than conventionalized mice and more cholic acid than mice colonized with B. dorei. In conclusion, we have isolated new strains and identified potentially positive clones. In vivo studies tend to show that coprostanol production activity has no effect on plasma cholesterol. In contrast, P. distasonis seems to decrease plasma cholesterol by a still unknown mechanism.","The sedimentary series, collected in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, constitute records or archives of the state of a system at a given moment of the past and relate its evolution in relation to natural disturbances and anthropogenic pressure. In the following manuscript, the sedimentary record of a fish pond has been studied using a multidisciplinary approach. In particular, the characterization at the molecular and macromolecular scale of the organic matter in sediments of the pond Lansquenet allowed to reconstruct the history of its watershed. On the basis of biomarkers and molecular ratios (terrestrial to aquatic ratio: TAR(HC), C29\u002fC27(ST), aquatic\u002fmacrophyte proxy: Paq, perylene, syringyl\u002fvanillyl, cinnamyl\u002fvanillyl, acid\u002faldehyde of syringyl and vanillyl units), this work has enabled us to understand, at the scale of a watershed, the changes in organic matter origins (terrestrial and\u002for aquatic, natural and\u002for anthropogenic) over a period of several centuries. Moreover, the results unraveled the depositional conditions as well as preservation conditions in the sedimentary profile, directly influenced by land use and human activities. The confrontation of organic geochemical data with sedimentological, mineralogical and palynological data was a real benefit and validated the use of a series of organic compounds as relevant and sensitive biomarkers regarding environmental and paleoenvironmental modifications. This study highlighted thus the succession of use of the Lansquenet site from a swampy area to the settlement of a fish pond punctuated by drier periods","Nowadays, new technologies are rising steadily and forming an integral part in the daily lives of everyone. They take advantage of the development of electronic systems for which the complexity requires the use of memory devices more and more efficient and with large storage capacities. Because of some performance degradation, the scaling of Flash technology who was so far predominant in the non-volatile memories market, is today reaching its limits. As a result, different emerging resistive memories are being developed. Among them, the phase-change memory technology PCRAM is very attractive because of its non-volatility, scalability, as well as reduced cost compared to standard Flash. Nevertheless, to compete with other technologies and to address the embedded applications market, PCRAM still face some challenges, such as decreasing the programming current densities, increasing the programming speed and increasing the thermal stability of the two memory states. For that purpose, different solutions have been tried in the literature, including using new device architectures and optimized phase-change materials. In this work, we are interested in investigating the failure mechanisms that affect thermal and temporal stability of phase change memories, in particular the retention of the RESET state and the stability of the programmed states disturbed by the drift phenomenon. The development of alternative materials using an optimized stoichiometry or incorporating doping allows us to achieve high electrical performance devices and to reach the required retention properties of embedded applications and particularly the automotive one. Moreover, thanks to the development of a new pre-coding procedure, these devices allow to keep stable the preprogrammed data on the memory chip during the soldering step of the latter on the electronic circuit. They represent a promising solution for Smart-Card applications. Finally, we have proposed an optimized programming procedure which enables to reduce the drift effect of the resistance of the SET state observed for optimized materials. This drift phenomenon was investigated by using low frequency noise measurements. Therefore, we have shown that this effect is due to the structural relaxation of amorphous parts in the active material. Besides, we highlighted for the first time the major influence of interface defects on the low-frequency noise of this state.","As expected life of a hip prosthesis is still limited, new concepts of implants seek to preserve bone stock of the younger patients. This Ph. D. Thesis aims at developing and evaluating the potential of computer simulations to predict bone adaptation clinically observed with one of these new concepts: \"the stemless Munting hip prosthesis\" Initially, a retrospective multifactorial study involving a series of 103 young patients operated with the Munting hip prosthesis highlighted the significant influence of the position of the implant and the patient's weight on bone turnover seen on postoperative X-rays. After modification of bone remodeling model developped by Huiskes, a retrospective multivariate finite element 2D model was used to check the good correlation between calculated results and clinical observations. In a second step, we developed a patient specific 3D prospective model using medical imaging of a young patient (16 years) operated with a Munting hip prosthesis. The results have pointed out the inadequacy of a 2D loading model but also the need to modify the bone remodeling law in the special case of a bone growth phase. Our approach, which relied on observation of clinical outcomes, will help contribute to the development of new designs of implants for younger patients. 3D loading conditions and prospective study of additional clinical cases should help improving the proposed patient specific model in the future.","Mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) are naturally occurring and problematic compounds in natural gas and crude oil. They are present at concentration levels varying by several orders of magnitude. In addition to health and environmental problems, Hg catalyses the corrosion of aluminium components, with potentially dramatic consequences in processing plants. For As, high concentrations can cause catalyst poisoning and can also induce toxic solid deposition in surface processes or in pipes. A reliable assessment of the concentrations of these two critical elements in hydrocarbon streams is still necessary to anticipate problems and possibly design a treatment unit.The determination and speciation of these two trace elements from deep reservoirs is a very different approach from that applied in clean rooms. The question of the reliability and representativeness of the sampling carried out on site is predominant compared to the analysis and speciation of mercury and arsenic. Sampling and analysis of trace elements in natural gas and oil are full of potential artefacts. In industry, when looking at routine trace element measurements, it is not uncommon to be wrong by several orders of magnitude. This is due to poor consideration of artefacts, including the risk of false positives due to contamination or false negatives due to the delayed breakthrough effect of trace compounds in a well test.The main objectives of this thesis are to track down potential artefacts during sampling and analysis of mercury and arsenic and to propose improvements during these two steps in order to reliably and representatively assess Hg and As concentrations in petroleum fluids.","Tissue-type plasminogen activator is a serine protease involved in numerous cerebral functions and dysfunctions. We previously reported that its expression decreased with age in several brain areas. Interestingly, aging is also associated with a cognitive impairment, which can be delayed by environmental stimulations. The aim of my thesis was to determinate the mechanisms underlying tPA-influenced behaviors, focusing my interest on environmental enrichment. Taken together, my results provide strong evidence that tPA is critically involved in the regulation of numerous behaviors, particularly of spatial and emotional memories. In addition, we reveal that environmental factors modulate tPA expression through an epigenetic mechanism, i. E. Histone acetylation. Finally, the molecular mechanism underlying tPA-influenced spatial memory has been characterized. Altogether, my works lead to a greater comprehension of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the complex relations between tPA, cognitive functions and environment.","For an agent, it is very challenging to autonomously elaborate and make use of a visual representation of its open environment. It is necessary to introduce new categories for unseen objects, and recognize already seen objects to refine and make evolve the representation, which is even more difficult when undergoing uncertainty and variability under uncontrolled operation conditions. The autonomy of the agent in classification, its adaptation to a changing environment as well as continual representation building are important properties of such a dynamic machine learning system. However, in some of the existing systems, especially with neural networks, the acquired representation tends to gradually drift away from initial observations which causes catastrophic forgetting. Another challenge comes from the decision whether incoming observations are new or belong to already seen objects. One has to detect novelty and introduce a new concept or class if necessary, and maintain the already acquired representation, i.e. recognize the object and make use of new observations appropriately, which is part of the more general problem of finding a meaningful and robust representation under the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this thesis, we address these challenges by adopting a state-of-the-art continual unsupervised rep- resentation learning model based on a specific Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture that we extended and applied on sequences of images showing different objects. Assuming that, in a realistic environment, there is some continuity in the sequence of object observations, the first contribution is an algorithm that robustly detects when object class changes occur in the image stream based on the dynamic evolution of the observation likelihood. It is shown that the thus obtained clusters in the representation space are more consistent with real objects and therefore facilitate the classiffication of known objects. The second contribution replaces the first approach and further increases the autonomy of the model by introducing an algorithm based on the Hotelling t-squared statistical hypothesis test that is able to continuously detect class changes and simultaneously decides if the currently observed object is novel or already present in the learnt representation. Extensive experimental results on several image benchmarks show that this self supervised continual learning approach is able to build representations that favor the autonomy of the agent by minimising supervision while maintaining a high object recognition accuracy compared to the state of the art","About 53 % of the milk produced in Veracruz is used for the manufacture of artisanal cheeses, however this milk is not subjected to any quality analysis, so the content of contaminants such as pesticides and mycotoxins could be found in cheeses. Pesticides, such as organochlorines (POCs), can increase the incidence of cancer and act as an endocrine disruptor; Additionally mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) and aflatoxin M2 (AFM2), are considered carcinogenic. The consumption of cheese with these toxins can put the health of the consumer at risk; however, there are only reports on the concentration of these compounds in cheeses, and cheese data consumption by the population of Veracruz are not available. The objective of this work was to evaluate the health risk due to the consumption of contaminated cheese (fresh and Oaxaca) with POC's and AFM1. In order to attain this objective, fresh and Oaxaca cheeses were randomly sampled at 40 groceries in Veracruz city, in three different years (2014, 2015 and 2016), covering periods of drought and rain. The concentration of POC's (n= 20) was quantified by CG-MS and that of AFs by HPLC. Cheese intake data were obtained from a purchase frequency questionnaire (n = 100) and from a 7 days food diary questionnaire (n = 309 for each type cheese). The risk assessment for exposure of the population to AFM1 was calculated by the combination of probability density functions (PDF) of AFM1 concentration, Oaxaca cheese consumption and body weight (probabilistic methodology). POCs were detected only in 5 % of the samples at concentrations above the quantification limit (LOQ = 0.01 mg kg-1), which showst that consumer exposure is low. The average consumption of fresh and Oaxaca cheese was 50.9 g person-1 d-1 and 47.8 g person-1 d-1, respectively. Only in 37 % of Oaxaca cheese samples, the concentration of AFM1 and in the 10 samples of AFM2 was higher than the value established by the European Commission of 0.05 \u03bcg kg-1. The exposure of children (5.9 \u03bcg AFM1 kg body weight-1 d-1 and 0.5 \u03bcg AFM2 kg body weight-1 d-1) was higher than found in adults (2.32 \u03bcg AFM1 kg body weight-1 d-1 and 0.2 \u03bcg AFM2 kg body weight-1 d-1). Taking into account a TDI of 1 ng kg-1 pc d-1 the results indicated that health that the 72.8 % And 51% of the adult and child population, respectively, of the population of Veracruz city is at for consuming contaminated Oaxaca cheese with AFM1 and about 13% and 3% of the infant and adult population, respectively, due to the consumption of AFM2. The present study is the first research on the exposure of Veracruz population concerning contaminated cheeses with AFM1 and AFM2.","Animal botulism, which affects mainly poultry, wildbirds and cattle, is a neuroparalytic disease caused by the action of botulinum neurotoxins type C, D, C\u002fD and D\u002fC. They are produced by Clostridium botulinum group III, an anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria belonging to the genospecies Clostridium novyi sensu lato alongside Clostridium novyi and Clostridium haemolyticum. The epidemiology of animal botulism is still poorly understood and molecular typing data are missing. This is mainly due to the unavailibity of typing tools for C. novyi sensu lato characterization, mostly because strain isolation is very difficult. The objective of the PhD project is to develop typing tools adapted to this specific context to be able to perform epidemiological investigations during animal botulism outbreaks and strain tracking in the future. First, an isolation method was developed and validated using strains involved in animal botulism outbreaks in France. This method allowed the isolation of 35 strains from avian botulism outbreaks. Then, a MLVA (Multi Loci Variable number of tandem repeats analysis) typing tool was evaluated on the isolated strains and used in real conditions during the investigation of two animal botulism outbreaks. Another potentiel typing approach was then explored through the study of CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats \u2013 CRISPR associated protein) systems. The results revealed the presence of these systems in 95 % of  C. novyi sensu lato genomes, with a great diversity (6 different types of CRISPR-Cas system). This high diversity prevents the development of a typing tool based on these CRISPR-Cas systems. Finally, following the optimization of the different steps preceding sequencing, C. novyi sensu lato genomes were compared to identify new relevant targets. This work allowed the development of an approach to sequence strains involved in avian botulism (from strain isolation to whole genome sequencing) and to set up an MLVA method that is particularly adapted to the study of avian botulism. It has also allowed the identification of new targets that are very promising for the development of new tools in the future, usable to investigate all animal botulism outbreaks.","This PhD work aimed to explore factors impacting the relationship between the environment, the host, the host microbiome and the pathogens, starting with the transition of the disease triangle to the disease pyramid and exploring the relationships of all these elements, based on field work data. We analyzed skin microbiome composition of tadpoles of three amphibian species (Alytes obstetricans, Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) in a mountain range (the Pyrenees) and how the species A. obstetricans was additionally linked to the presence and disease status of the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), responsible for the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis. The skin microbiome is an essential component of amphibians' health, considering its role in the amphibian immunity. I considered a combination of different factors, including: climatic variables (length of the growing season, number of consecutive dry days and simple precipitation index); lake characteristics (geographic coordinates, lake surface and altitude); anthropogenic proxies (tourism pressure, livestock presence and fish introduction); as well as several Bd variables (Bd-positive and negative populations, enzootic and epizootic populations, infected and uninfected individuals). I found that the presence and relative abundance of abundant bacterial taxa in the tadpole skin responded to both growing season length and simple precipitation index. Considering that Bd infection is more usually acquired at the tadpole stage, such impact could interfere in host susceptibility to Bd or even other pathogens. Tourism pressure and livestock did not impact bacterial taxa abundance. However, some bacterial taxa differed significantly in abundance between lakes with and without fish; these taxa were all more abundant in lakes with fish, indicating a dominance of a few taxa and potentially a less balanced microbiome. Lastly, amphibian species was also significant for shaping the bacterial community. To evaluate the interaction between the pathogen Bd and the skin microbiome of A. obstetricans, a species known to be susceptible to chytridiomycosis, I analyzed both bacterial and micro eukaryotic skin communities. I compared: uninfected vs. infected populations, enzootic (persistent) vs. epizootic (declining) populations, as well as (in infected populations) infected vs. uninfected individuals, for the whole microbiome and detected specific ASVs that were significantly different in abundance and frequency in the various communities. The bacterial community showed different alpha diversity patterns over time in enzootic, epizootic and uninfected lakes. Such variation suggests a selection process acting on the diversity of the skin bacterial community of tadpoles from epizootic populations, which may allow some individuals to survive and, potentially, form an endemic population. With my work, I could cover the different and complex interrelationships between host, host microbiome, environment and pathogen, and how alterations in one of these factors (or in a combination of them) can alter disease outcome and therefore, host health. The results found here are of great use for defining future conservation strategies against chytridiomycosis.","Developing research and markets around by-products has become indispensable not only from the environmental point of view but also for the circular economy of the industrial processes. In this context, humins constitute one of the most promising by-products. Humins are formed during the biorefinery conversion of lignocellulosic biomass derived sugars into furanic compounds. They consist in a dark-colored, highly viscous, mixture of oligomers derived from random condensations between the several intermediates (mainly HMF and derivatives) formed during the acid catalyzed process. Our group, along with many recent researches, have proven the many hidden possibilities of this furan-rich mixture, which might in turn be attractive for the interesting properties that humins can offer. In this thesis we report several studies performed in order to valorize this material, with a particular focus on humins foams, new polymeric carbon-based porous materials derived from industrial humins in a straightforward and economic attractive way. Humins foams can be prepared by direct heating treatments of humins industrially obtained without any preliminary step such as purification, separation or modification. We show in this manuscript that is possible to control the foams properties (pores dimension, degree of cells opening, morphology, carbon content, etc.) by controlling the preparation parameters such as temperatures applied, heating ramps, gas flow, amount of humins or kind of crucible. The mechanism of foaming has been revealed, several preparation conditions screening carried out, and the material characterized from the chemical, physico-chemical and structural point of view. Furthermore, for the first time, thermal hazard studies for both humins and humins foams have been carried out, which are indispensable for their transport and commercialization in support of entire Biorefinery. Humins foams properties have been deeply studied and tested in several fields, highlighting their most promising applications. Among these, humins foams has been successfully used in the preparation of alumina porous materials by sacrificial templating, which opens the path to future investigations involving further porous materials preparation. Along humins foams, also preliminary studies of crude humins application as dyes for sensitized solar cells and for further materials and composites preparations were carried out. This thesis not only proves how promising humins materials are, highlighting their major advantages and the points of s trength that would be competitive on the market, but also aims to increase the interest around these materials. This thesis offers a good starting point for further and future valorizations, with advantages that will involve the environment along with the entire Biorefinery.","This thesis deals with the study of stochastic modeling of limit order book and two stochastic control problems under liquidity risk and price impact. The thesis is made of two distinct parts.In the first part, we investigate markovian limit order book model under different aspects. In particular, in Chapter 2, we introduce a model of cumulative depth representation. We consider different arrival events with dependencies on current state. Chapter 3 handles the model stability problem through a semi-martingale approach for the denumerable Markov Chain classification. We give for each problem a model calibration from empirical facts such as mean average profile of limit order book density. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the model estimation and model calibration by means of market data flow. Thus, we compare our model to market data through stylized facts and empirical facts. We give a concrete calibration to the different stability problems. Finally, in Chapter 5, we handle the optimal liquidation problem in the cumulative depth representation model framework.We study, in the second part, an optimal liquidation problem of an investor under stochastic resilience. This problem may be formulated as a stochastic singular control problem. We show that the associated value function is the unique viscosity solution of an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We suggest an iterative numerical method to compute the optimal strategy. The numerical scheme convergence is obtained through the monotonicity, stability and consistancy creteria.","Acidic zeolites are materials widely used in heterogeneous catalysis in the petrochemistry and refining. The identification of radical species in the coke of deactivated zeolite catalysts whereas these solids still exhibit an important catalytic activity opens a new way of thinking for catalysis. However, the complexity of the coke molecules does not allow the clear identification of radical species or separated charge states responsible for coke formation and\u002for catalytic activity enhancement. For a better understanding of these phenomena, it is therefore crucial to elucidate the parameters that control their behaviour. In this context, this work aims to investigate the influence of physicochemical properties (Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acidity, Si\u002fAl, particles size, mesoporosity, defects...) of a classical ZSM-5 zeolite on the radical species formed (nature and lifetime) inside their pores from the adsorption of aromatic molecule which models coke molecules (t-stilbene). We have gradually changed during the synthesis or by post-synthesis treatments (desilication, dealumination), a single property among those mentioned above to assess the impact of this property on the radical species generated during the aromatic molecule adsorption. The results show in particular the importance of the aluminum content on the strength of the acidic sites and the existence of a correlation between the presence of strong Br\u00f8nsted-Lewis acid pairs (SBLP) and the quantity of stabilized radical species. Whatever the parameter, the experiments all lead to the conclusion that the ratio of the percentage of SBLP by the microporous volume is intimately related to the charge transfers.","This thesis was conducted under a contract between the \"Electronic Measurements\" Research Group within the Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory of Nancy and the Research Department of EDF. The focus of this thesis is the behavior of implantable defibrillators in low frequency (50 Hz-50 kHz) magnetic environments. The first chapter introduces the principles and summarizes the basics of the interactions between electromagnetic fields and active medical implants. General and specific data concerning implantable medical devices are also presented. The main aim of the second chapter is to determine the fields and\u002for electric currents induced in a human body by a magnetic source at low frequency (50 Hz to 50 kHz). The calculations are based on a finite integral method elements model using CST software. In the third chapter, a virtual phantom is described, based on 77 different organs. It is constructed using the Virtual Family. Based on the above results, an implantable defibrillator is inserted into the virtual model to calculate the voltages induced at the end of the probe. These voltages are compared with threshold values obtained from the Standards to demonstrate their very low values regardless of the frequency of the magnetic field. The fourth and final chapter presents the results obtained for experimental validation with in vitro tests in an electromagnetic phantom made of gelatin, placed within a Faraday cage. A cardiac signal is generated as an artificial lure. The experimental set up is configured and managed by virtual instrumentation (GPIB HPVEE). It controls the power source and collects telemetry signals via the defibrillator. Some reversible episodes were observed at 50 Hz showing the sensitivity of the electronics (input filter) according to the ICD models destined for Europe (50 Hz) and the USA (60 Hz). These are normal values for heart rate. The series of measurements showed no failure for four defibrillators tested in electromagnetic fields up to 3.44 mT","The use of microfluidics in chemistry is drawing more and more attention to chemists. Its fields of application are expanding, and one sees it as the future of fine organic chemistry, because it allows a very precise control of the reaction and its parameters. On the other hand, plasmas, with its energy and reactivity, becomes an ideal tool for \"clean\" chemistry synthesis. Indeed, plasma processes exhibits benefits such as being atmospheric, solvent-free, catalysts-free processes. This thesis is located at the intersection of microfluidics technologies and plasma processes. A novel diphasic, microfluidics device integrating generation of a confined, atmospheric plasma, has been developed, designed and manufactured.  In these reactors of a new kind, optical and electrical measurements have been able to demonstrate the formation of a plasma in the microstructures. In this plasma are generated many reactive species, including several important radicals, that the use of the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation tool described as reaction intermediates for functionalization of organic molecules.  Guided by this numerical simulation, we treated two model liquid, organic molecules, cyclohexane and benzene, with plasmas of argon, oxygen, carbon dioxide and ammonia. GC analysis of the liquid coming out of the reactor attested the effective hydroxylation, carbonylation and amination of these molecules, for  conversions and selectivities depending on the nature of the gas and the liquid, as well as many operating conditions such as the voltage and frequency of the electrical signal applied to the reactor, or the temperature of the whole system.  The success of these different controlled functionalizations, at atmospheric pressure, without solvent nor catalyst, of a cyclic hydrocarbon opens major stakes on the use of this type of process for industrial synthesis chemistry.","The lung cancer is at the first place of the death at the world level and in France to. Today, the used molecular targets act on cells which has a speed proliferation, so the fact could explain their ineffectiveness on the non small cells lung cancer (NSCLC) which presents the particularities to have cells which have a slowly proliferation. So, it is very important to discover new molecular targets induced by new anti-cancer molecules which can act on these cells with the slowly proliferation. Previously the laboratory has identified two molecular targets HEF1 and B2 expressed in NSCLC. HEF1 is involved in numerous cellular functions such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, motility. B2 discovered and identified by the laboratory overlapped a part of the HEF1 genomic DNA. This 54 Kb non coding RNA is expressed in different tissues and specifically expressed in lung tissue as the HEF1 gene. Having regard the B2 RNA characteristics and the homology of sequence with HEF1, we put in evidence the existence of a regulation of the HEF1 gene by the B2 RNA. This regulation induced by B2 would be made by the miRNA mechanism. In fact, this large non-coding RNA would be a precursor of miRNA which could for some of them being directed against the HEF1 gene such as hsa-mir-146B. This miRNA overexpressed in NSCLC-N6 cells, has a high homology with the B2 gene and could regulate HEF1 gene on the exon 4. So these genes could be an approach of a new gene therapy whose the expression is modulated by cytostatic molecules such as the molecule A190 patented by the lab.","Preterm birth remains a major problem in obstetrics. Therefore, it has been a topic of interest for many researchers. Among the many methods used to record the uterine contractility, the most used is the abdominal EHG, as being an easy to use and a non-invasive tool. Many studies have reported that the use of this signal could be a very powerful tool to monitor pregnancy and to detect labor. It indeed permits to access the uterine as well as the synchronization of the uterine activity, by using multiple signals. It has been shown that the connectivity analysis gave promising results when using EHG recordings in clinical application, such as the classification labor\u002fpregnancy contractions. However, in almost all previous studies EHG correlation matrices were often reduced keeping only their mean and standard deviations thus relevant information may have been missed due to this averaging, which may induce the relatively low classification rate reported so far. To characterize precisely the correlation matrix and quantify the associated connectivity, we proposed in this thesis to use a network measure technique based on graph theory. According to this approach, the obtained correlation matrix can be represented as graphs consisting of a set of nodes (electrodes) interconnected by edges (connectivity\u002fcorrelation values between electrodes). The new framework, to analyze the EHG signals recorded during pregnancy and labor, is based on the characterization of the correlation between the uterine electrical activities and on its precise quantification by using graph theory approach. The processing pipeline includes i) the estimation of the statistical dependencies between the different recorded EHG signals, ii) the quantification of the obtained connectivity matrices using graph theory-based analysis and iii) the clinical use of network measures for pregnancy monitoring as well as for the classification between pregnancy and labor EHG bursts. A comparison with the already existing parameters used in the state of the art for labor detection and preterm labor prediction will also be performed. We also investigate a new method to study the EHG source connectivity, to overcome the problem of computing the connectivity at the abdominal surface level. The results of this thesis showed that this network-based approach is a very promising tool to quantify uterine synchronization, when applied at the abdominal level, for a better pregnancy monitoring. We expect this approach to be further used for the monitoring of pregnancy and would thus help for the early prediction of preterm labor.","Cement-based materials are widely used in various engineering structures. They are subjected to multi-physical processes such as mechanical loading, drying and desiccation, temperature change, corrosion etc. These materials also contain multi-scale heterogeneities such as pores and inclusions. Macroscopic mechanical properties of such materials are inherently affected by micro-structural evolution. Among other aspects, damage due to cracking is an essential mechanism of failure of cement-based materials. The key issue for modeling progressive failure process is the description of transition from diffuse damage (micro-cracks) to localized cracks. In this study, we have adopted the phase-field method for this purpose. The basic formulation of this method is first recalled in the thesis. Our contributions are then mainly composed of three parts.The first part is devoted to the study of deformation and damage in reinforced concrete due to steel corrosion processes. Two new laboratory tests are first presented, respectively allowing the characterization of corrosion product expansion and the estimation of local elastic properties of corrosion product. The damage process is then coupled with chemical corrosion kinetics. The laboratory tests are simulated by using the phase-field method. The evolution of deformation, stress and induced damage is investigated.In the second part, the damage and cracking of concrete due to drying shrinkage is investigated. A large number of studies have been reported but most of them were limited to two-dimensional configuration. In our work, we have performed three-dimensional phase-field simulation of concrete samples subjected to drying process. The distribution of inclusions is based tomographic images of real samples. The evolution of damage field and the propagation of cracked zones are analyzed. The effects of spatial distribution of inclusions are also investigated through comparisons between 2D and 3D simulations.Cement-based materials are also porous media and exhibit plastic deformation in cement paste. In the third part, we are interested in study the effect of pores and plastic deformation on cracking process. For this purpose, a macroscopic plastic criterion issued from nonlinear homogenization is first presented. A series of numerical simulations are performed. It is found that the cracking process is significantly affected by the spatial distribution of pores and plastic deformation of solid matrix.","The interaction with tactile systems is ubiquitous in todays world, where the primary mean of interaction is the touch of a finger on the screen of the device, i.e. smartphone or tablet. The ability of these interfaces to render different tactile sensations is quite limited, and mostly composed by the vibration of the whole device, which limits their rendering abilities. Few haptic technologies show the promising opportunity to be coupled with capacitive position acquisition techniques. Among them, there are the friction modulation techniques, also called surface haptic techniques: electrovibration and ultrasonic vibration. The former increases the friction between the finger and a high voltage supplied surface by electrostatic attraction, whereas the second reduces the friction in function of the vibrational state of the explored surface. In this thesis, for both techniques, a precise physical modelling approach is developed, and assessed by experimental results and comparison; thus, design rules for these tactile devices can be deduced to optimize the tactile rendering.  Moreover, physical and perceptual independence of both techniques are proven with the development of a coupled stimulator. In the end, the development of a new tactile device, named E-ViTa, developed following the design rules outlined, is described, and a new control strategy considering the perceptual characteristics of the finger is integrated, allowing the expansion of the rendering capabilities of the surface haptic devices.","The recent development of airborne full-waveform lidar systems, that are able to provide more than a simple 3D representation of the topographic surfaces, has arisen many questions with respect to the analysis of urban areas, and in relation with traditional multiple pulse sensors. Indeed, the recorded lidar waveforms provide additional information about the geometry and the radiometry of the targets. The final aim of this thesis is to process the raw data in order to achieve a 3D automatic land-cover classification, as a basis for various subsequent applications. The proposed workflow is composed of two main stages. The first step consists in processing the waveform in order to generate an improved 3D point cloud, and retrieve morphological information about these points. Two distinct methods have been proposed. The first one aims to improve the standard approach, which assumes that all echoes can be modelled by the Gaussian curve. The second method hypothesizes a mixture of several models -- each echo is then characterized separately -- and allows to propose a simple physical and flexible solution. Afterwards, the generated 3D points are classified using both spatial features and the morphological ones retrieved from the previous processing step. A supervised approach using Support Vector Machines is adopted in order to label ground, building, and vegetation areas. Furthermore, the classifier is coupled with a feature selection step. Eventually, results with high accuracy are achieved, and enhance the relevance of full-waveform data for automatically mapping urban areas.","Numerical analyses of heated gas flows, particularly at low speeds, are often performed with the aid of simplifying assumptions. These restrictive assumptions represent the flow of a gas somewhat truncated in its real state and are not easy to validate. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to develop a numerical tool to validate the commonly used approximations. For this reason, a numerical code for variable-density flows is fully developed to study heated gases in natural, forced or mixed convection, in both laminar and transitional flow regimes. The dynamic and energy conservation equations are solved without simplifying assumptions (such as the Boussinesq approximation and the low Mach number approximation), in a non-radiative field and with negligible viscous dissipation. The ideal gas law is used as state law. The coupled set of equations is solved with an iterative predictor-corrector algorithm, which uses a second-order finite difference formulation for the spatial discretization, and the Crank-Nicolson method for the time discretization. The numerical method is validated using analytical solutions as well as the differentially heated cavity problem. Three flows of increasing numerical and physical complexity are then investigated. These flows physically progress from a confined flow (differentially heated closed cavity), then a semi-confined flow (backward facing step) to an open flow (a free-plane jet).","Prematurity is responsible for neonatal mortality and morbidity. Premature infants are at risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), characterized by motor and cognitive deficits lasting until adulthood. Hypoxia-ischemia, inflammation and male gender have been identified as CP risk factors. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) have been proposed as neuroprotective agent to improve infants sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes. Despite the reduction of CP prevalence by 33 %, MgSO4 use in clinic remains not systematic, notably in France, since its long term proper effects and its actions mechanisms are not well-known. Our work consisted in improving the knowledge of MgSO4 actions and effects. In order to evaluate MgSO4 (600 mg\u002fkg) preventive actions mechanisms and its potential proper effects, two mouse models of cerebral neonatal lesion at 5 days (P5) have been used. We showed that the excitotoxic model (IBO), as the hypoxic-ischemic model (HI), have induced sensorimotor deficits in pups in both sexes, as motor and cognitive deficits in adult mice, more pronounced in male mice in the IBO model. In the latter, MgSO4 administration prevented at short and long term sensorimotor and cognitive alterations, as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions systems alterations. In the HI model, which causes more severe lesions, cognitive deficits have not been prevented by MgSO4. We also showed that MgSO4 induced neuroprotection is multifactorial, as MgSO4 reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission and apoptosis. Work in progress in the HI model indicates that MgSO4 may decrease inflammatory process, in a sex dependant manner. MgSO4 pre-treatment did not induce deleterious secondary effects in the measured parameters in our study.","This thesis deals with fundamental issues related to phonons in hot-carrier solar cells, athird generation photovoltaic technology. This concept aims at extracting photogeneratedcharge carriers before their reach a thermal equilibrium with the lattice, and exhibits a the-oretical efficiency close to thermodynamic limit. One of the main issue is to hinder carriercooling, which occurs through LO-phonon emission. In addition to the idea of screeningthe electron-phonon interaction, one approach consists in designing an absorber in which theLO-phonon has an intrinsic lifetime longer than what it is in conventional materials, en-hancing the rate of its reabsorption by the carriers. The LO-phonon decay and lifetimeis first investigated in semiconductors within density functional perturbation theory. Spe-cific criteria for relevant absorbing materials choosing, from a phonon point of view, arederived. A full study of the LO-phonon lifetime is performed on a singular material, andthe possibility to achieve the sufficient phononic requierements is discussed. Secondly, theabove-mentioned electron-phonon interaction is modelled in superlattices. The couplingstrength is related to the LO-phonon induced macroscopic electric field, which allows tostudy the directional dependence of the phonon emission. The latter reveals to differentlyaffect the dimensionality of the electronic and phononic interacting populations. Thisstudy calls for development of these structure in the framewok of hot-carrier solar cells.","Mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers are unipolar semiconductor lasers, which have become widely used sources for applications such as gas spectroscopy, free-space communications or optical countermeasures. Applying external per-turbations such as optical feedback or optical injection leads to a strong modification of the quantum cascade laser prop-erties. Optical feedback impacts the static properties of mid-infrared Fabry-Perot and distributed feedback quantum cas-cade lasers, inducing power increase, threshold reduction, modification of the optical spectrum, which can become either single- or multimode, and enhanced beam quality of broad-area transverse multimode lasers. It also leads to a different dynamical behavior, and a quantum cascade laser subject to optical feedback can oscillate periodically or even become chaotic: this work provides the very first analysis of optical instabilities in the mid-infrared range. A numerical study of optical injection furthermore proves that quantum cascade lasers can injection-lock over a few gigahertz, where they should experience enhanced stability and especially improved modulation bandwidth. Furthermore, some promising dynamics appear outside the locking range with periodic oscillations at a tunable frequency or high-intensity events. A quantum cascade laser under external control could therefore be a source with enhanced properties for the usual mid-infrared applications, but could also address new applications such as tunable photonic oscillators, extreme events gen-erators, chaotic LIDAR, chaos-based secured communications or unpredictable countermeasures","Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a common tumor phenotype associated with many human cancers. It is a consequence of the deficiency of the MMR (mismatch repair) system. Clinically, MSI cancers have greatly benefited in recent years from the advent of Immune Checkpoint Protein Inhibitors (ICKi), which have led to significant therapeutic advances, particularly in the treatment of patients with metastatic MSI cancer. In the era of immunotherapy, the detection of the MSI phenotype is therefore a major challenge in clinical oncology. Another challenge is to detect the predictive factors of sensitivity or resistance to these new precision therapies in patients. During my thesis, I worked on the detection of the MSI phenotype in cancer, with a modern method of high throughput sequencing of tumor DNA.  I developed a new algorithm, MSICare, and demonstrated the optimal performance of this new diagnostic tool [100% Sensitivity and Specificity] (Ratovomanana et al. Gastroenterology 2021 and Patent EP21305121s). The perspectives are now to demonstrate the high performances of the MSICare tool in pan-cancer, in order to raise it to the conditions where it could be the authority in tomorrow's clinical routine. In a second part of my thesis, I identified DNA and RNA markers predictive of the efficacy of ICKi in these patients. The results are encouraging, but it is essential to validate these data by studying additional cohort of patients.","The impregnation of fabrics, which are double-scale fibrous media that are commonly used to reinforce composite materials, remains to this day a relatively poorly controlled process. The increasing use of natural, bio-based fibres which present specific features, such as their sensitivity to humidity, accentuates the need for a better understanding of the involved phenomena. This thesis explores the importance of the double pore scale of the fabric, often ignored by the models despite its influence on most of the processes involved. The pore morphology was characterized by quantitative image analysis, while the microstructure of the fibrous preforms could also be extracted from numerical simulations of their mechanical behavior. An intensive focus was then made on the influence of capillarity within the tows. A detailed study of wetting dynamics allowed the identification of a transition between two modes of dissipation, depending on the contact-line velocity, which may also be observed at a macroscopic scale in infiltration processes. The modeling of a double-scale porous medium's permeability, associated with the derivation of the capillary pressure in a dynamic regime, finally lead to the formulation of a model, which describes the impregnation kinetics of a unidirectional medium for a specific flow regime.","There exists an unmet clinical need to provide doctors with a new method that streamlines minimally invasive endoscopic treatment of colorectal cancer to single operator procedures assisted by in-situ and real-time accurate tissue characterization for informed treatment decisions. A promising solution to this problem has been developed at the ICube laboratory, in which the flexible interventional endoscope (Karl Storz) was completely robotized, so allowing a single operator to independently telemanipulate the endoscope and two insertable therapeutic instruments with a joint control unit. However, the robot-assisted flexible endoscope is subject to the same diagnostic accuracy limitations as standard endoscopy systems. It has been demonstrated that endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) has a good potential for imaging disorders in the gastrointestinal tract and differentiating healthy tissue from diseased. Neither OCT, nor the robotized endoscope can solve the limitations of current standard of care for colon cancer management alone. Combining these two technologies and developing a new platform for early detection and treatment of cancer is the main interest of this work, with the aim of developing a state-of-the-art OCT imaging console and probe integrated with the robotized endoscope. The capabilities of this new technology for imaging of the interior of the large intestine were tested in pre-clinical experiments showing potential for improvement in margin verification during minimally invasive endoscopic treatment in the telemanipulation mode.","In eukaryotes, the transcription cycle is composed of several steps, each of them being strictly controlled by several factors. These factors act mainly through modulation of RNA Polymerase II catalytic activity and chromatin remodeling. In addition, in mammals and in yeast, some MAP kinases have been shown to be recruited on chromatin in response to external cues to control transcription. For many years, pre-initiation and initiation were considered as the main controlled steps. However, RNA Polymerase II undergoes a promoter-proximal pausing which is also crucial to regulate transcriptional activity. During my PhD, I addressed the functional relationships between the chromatin factor Corto, the MAPK ERK and the transcription factor Elongin during Drosophila wing tissue development. I have shown that Corto, ERK and one of its scaffold proteins MP1 form a complex on chromatin. This complex could regulate the recruitment on chromatin of Polycomb and Trithorax complexes in response to ERK signaling. Furthermore, I have shown that Corto and the elongation factor Elongin could both participate in the regulation of rhomboid, a gene involved in wing tissue development. Lastly, I studied the role of the interaction of Corto with some mRNA, one of these being the MP1 mRNA.","The purpose of this work was the synthesis and characterization of new aromatic ionomers for PEMFC. The ionomers are based on block copolymers containing hydrophilic blocks, functionalised with a perfluorinated acid, and hydrophobic blocks containing partially perfluorinated aromatic rings. The polymer main chain was performed by polycondensation reaction. The acidic functions were grafted onto the polymer in two steps: bromination and coupling Ullman reaction. Different copolymers with different lengths of hydrophilic block were synthetized. The membranes were obtained by casting, the impact of the solvent nature and Ionomer structure on the membrane morphology and properties was studied. The solvent has a strong impact on the membrane structuration at nanometric scale. By small angle neutrons scattering, we showed that the membrane morphology is depending on hydrophilic bloc length. The mechanical strengths and the conductivities of aromatic ionomer membranes are higher that the Nafion above 60\u00b0C that make them promising for PEMFC working at temperature higher than 100\u00b0C.","The project NEOPHIL aims to develop an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane hollow fiber from poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF) that resists to fouling amide time. This property can be achieved by adding a block copolymer called GEN in the fiber preparation solution in addition to the classic additive, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In this work, we focused on the quantification of additives on the surface, in the bulk and establishing the concentration profile by ATR-FTIR, T% -FTIR and Raman microscopy. These analyzes showed that half of the PVP is washed away into the coagulation bath while GEN quantitatively remains anchored in the matrix. In the case of PVP, the formulation parameters such as the presence of solvent or PVP in the coagulation bath greatly affects the concentration profile at the interfaces. In addition a multi-criteria analysis between hydrophilicity provided by the additives and the fouling was established. This study was carried out by measurement of the water contact angle, water retention and water intrusion pressure of dry fibers in relation to the size and distribution of pores, the surface roughness (AFM) and the permeability to pure water. Water retention and water intrusion pressure seem to be the two most relevant techniques that can connect the physicochemical properties and filtration performance. A preliminary study on the aging behavior was also performed showing that GEN is not extracted while the PVP is lost partly by extraction and\u002for degradation. This phenomenon strongly affects the different parameters studied in the multi-criteria analysis.","Central part of extended amygdala (EAc) is associated to emotional states modulation in a number of physiological or pathological situations such as anxiety, fear, addiction or pain-related behaviors. EAc receives afferences from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) which is a major integrative center for viscero- and somato-sensory information. Numerous neuropeptides and associated receptors are expressed in the PB. In particular, exogenous morphine acts through mu opioid receptors found in high density in PB external lateral part (PBel). This region also displays a large concentration of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expressing neurons. This neurotrophine plays a critical role in development and nervous system regeneration but it is also known for its implication in synaptic plasticity mechanisms. We hypothesized that BDNF could be a critical element of the parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway, extended to the whole EAc pathway. We have thus assessed its implication in morphine analgesia and opiates addiction. Ibotenic acid injection or local specific BDNF gene deletion in the PBel reduces the expression of naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal-induced physical symptoms and significatively reduces morphine-induced analgesia without affecting tolerance phenomena associated with repetitive morphine injection. However, basal nociceptive sensibilities of animals were not affected and no influence on their anxiety level or motor capacities was observed. Moreover, the induction of transcription factor c-Fos by acute morphine or by naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal is reduced in EAc of BDNF-deleted mice. Our results, associated to the data from the literature, suggest an interaction between mu opioid receptors and BDNF in the parabrachio-EAc pathway.","Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) participate in and regulate almost all essential cellular functions. As a consequence, they are frequently involved in various pathologies (going from cancer development to viral replication and host cell infection) but their study remains a challenge.Thus understanding those interactions as well as finding small drug candidates able to modulate them, a field of research not currently fully developed, appear as the future of the healthcare industry.In this context, I chose to learn different techniques to study PPIs that are usually employed in academic (IMR laboratory, CNRS, France) or corporate environments (Genentech, USA). Moreover, I also worked on the development of small organic inhibitors of PPIs coupling in silico methodologies (chemo-informatics, Drug Design) to biological and structural validations.During my PhD, I could manage and work on different projects involving the study of PPIs involved in cancer signaling pathways as well as the development of potent antiviral drugs targeting the HIV and SARS viruses.My organizational, personal and scientific skills as well as the practical experience I developed on various techniques (from cell biology to biophysics, structural biochemistry and Drug Design), make me feel confident on the management of PPIs drug discovery projects.I am thus able to efficiently work on, and manage, the study of protein-protein interactions in various pathologies as well as the development of potent PPIs inhibitors, that will be a major breakthrough for Biotech\u002fPharma companies in the coming years.","Opening of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) at the plasma membrane of cells is the earliest event in response to mechanical stimulation. The conversion of force into an electrical signal is caused by the opening of different types of MSCs, including Piezo1\u002f2 and K2P TREK-1\u002fTREK-2\u002fTRAAK channels. Force-induced activation of MSCs is direct without the involvement of a second messenger, causing a change in membrane potential and secondarily triggering biochemical intracellular responses. Mechano-electrical transduction plays a key role in hearing, balance, touch and proprioception and is also involved in the autonomous regulation of blood pressure, respiration and urination. Thus, MSCs dysfunction is associated with a variety of inherited and acquired diseases. Significant progress has recently been made in identifying these channels, resolving their structure and understanding the mechanisms of MSCs gating. In addition to the prototypical activation by membrane tension, other gating mechanisms involving channel curvature and\u002for cytoskeleton elements are involved. In mammalian cells, two major types of MSCs coexist at the plasma membrane: non-selective cationic depolarizing channels and K+-selective hyperpolarizing channels. MSCs open in response to a variety of mechanical stimuli, such as local membrane stretch, cell compression, shear stress, cell swelling, bending of the primary cilium, and substrate deformation.In this thesis work, I studied the physiological role of Piezo1\u002f2 and TREK-1\u002fTREK-2\u002fTRAAK, as well as their gating mechanisms. Our results indicate a major role for Piezo1\u002f2 and TREK-1\u002fTREK-2\u002fTRAAK in the pathophysiology of arteries, kidney and adipose tissue. Our results also reveal a novel mechanism involving polycystins PC1\u002fPC2 and the cytoskeletal protein filamin A (FlnA) as negative regulators of MSCs. We identified TMEM33 as a novel interactor of PC2 at the endoplasmic reticulum, that regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis and influences cell death. Finally, we demonstrate a functional interaction between Piezo1\u002f2 and TREK-1\u002fTREK-2 of fibroblasts during wound healing.Overall, this work provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the mechanobiology and associated disease states. Our results will ultimately contribute to envisage new therapeutic strategies based on the use of force and\u002for pharmacological modulation of MSCs.","This work had three objectives:\uf081 To raise a inventory of the microbial diversity of raw milk, and to study the influence of the management practices of the herd on the microbiological profiles of milk;\uf082 To identify reservoirs susceptible to impact the regulation of the bacterial diversity of raw milk, and milking practices which can influence this diversity;\uf083 And finally to study the potential sources of the diversity of the dominant bacterial flora of the \u201cCamembert de Normandie AOP\u201d. In spite of their low microbial load, evidence of their good hygienic quality, the 260 analyzed raw milk had an important diversity. Variations between farms, as well in the proportions of microbial groups as by the observed extreme values, were revealing by the quantification of nine microbial groups. Hundred and twelve bacterial species and 17 species of yeasts were detected during a molecular inventory realized from 1697 isolates from 24 raw milk, with a dominance of Gram positive bacteria in particular staphylococci and coryneform bacteria. The application of the Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism technique on the bacterial DNA extracted from raw milk of two milkings, from the atmosphere of the milking places, from the surface of cow teats and from milking machines revealed the presence of common bacterial groups between these various ecosystems. The surface of teats seems to constitute the main reservoir of the dominant flora of raw milk, but a big part of the dominant bacteria of raw milk was not detected as being a member of the dominant flora of the studied ecosystems. The variations of microbial balances can certainly explain this observation, in particular by the expression in milk of secondary flora. The statistical analysis of factors which can explain the variability of the flora of raw milk, in terms of load and bacterial composition, revealed particularly the influence of the hygiene practices of teats, and of cleaning of milking machines, on the flora of technological interest. The hygiene practices seem to reduce the diversity of flora such as Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and ripening bacteria. The use of the rep-PCR, a genetic analysis technique, to study the diversity of presumptive Lactobacillus and presumptive coryneform bacteria, in raw milk, in camembert cheeses and in the environment of three cheese dairies, revealed the transmission of several isolates native of raw milk towards camembert cheeses. The origin of a part of the bacterial flora of camembert cheeses was not able to be connected with the dominant flora of the studied ecosystems, testifying probably of the expression in the camembert cheeses of under dominants flora of the environment, stemming certainly partly from raw milk. The presence, in camembert cheeses, of bacterial strains from raw milk augurs of the potential role of the flora of the raw milk in the process and the sensory qualities of the \u201cCamembert de Normandie AOP\u201d.","The synthesis of aromatic polyheterocyclic structures is studied by our group for more than twenty years. The functional modulation of the scaffolds led to two hits compounds, inhibitors of kinase DYRK1A belonging to the CMGC group. To understand the implication of this kinase in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer Disease), we envisioned to design the first radiotracer of DYRK1A by radiolabeling the hit compounds developed previously. The first part of this manuscript investigates the cyanation reaction of thiazolo [5,4-f] quinazolin-9 (8H) -ones from diaryliodonium, boronic ester or iodine derivatives. This work reveals the difficulty of synthesizing a heteroaryliodonium salt or a boronic ester from the studied heterocycles. Cyanation from a non-toxic cyanide ion source by palladium or copper catalyzed cross-coupling reaction was also unsuccessful. A second part is focus on a new eco-friendly method for the modulation of heterocycles developed by the laboratory with diaryliodonium salts as arylating agents of heteroaromatic rings. This new methodology was successfully applied to original heterocycles including a fused pyrimidinone. A third chapter described new access to linear thiazolo [4,5-g] quinazolin-8 (7H) -ones, functionalized at the C7 position. The thiazole ring fused to a quinazoline was successfully realized by cyclizing of a novel N-arylcyanothioformamides. During this work around 60 novel products were synthesized and characterized.","Alexandrium minutum is one of the toxic species that produce Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), threaten public health, aquaculture and tourism. In France, it was observed in 1988 in the region Bretagne. High levels of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxicity have been detected in the estuaries of Morlaix, Penz\u00e9, Rance, Abers and more recently, in the Bay of Brest. This work tries to define and place in order of hierarchy, the parameters driving A. minutum success in the phytoplankton community. Two approaches were adopted. The first was a temporal survey at the study site since 2009-2018. The second was the use of a 0D numerical model (based on physiological traits) to simulate the potential impact between physical and biological processes. A. minutum was placed in competition with 72 species which were uniformly selected. Results showed both seasonal and interannual variability of bloom phenology. It was marked by micro, followed by nano and then pico phytoplankton from April to October. A. minutum bloom occurred between June and August, a period of high temperature, low nutrient concentrations and high resource competition. However, environmental factors and competition explain only a part of its phenology. Though the model was able to reproduce the seasonal and interannual variability of A. minutum, simulation was inconsistent over the study period. The model highlights the increasing relevance of other biological processes in bloom regulation at decade scale. It might improve some models which are able to correctly predict instances of A. minutum presence or absence. The perspective is to have a model which can be applied and validated for the entire Bay of Brest.","Conductive polymer nanocomposites have been the object of intense researches and investigations recently. In fact, these materials have shown a great potential to be useful for many applications including different sectors. However, despite the promising results reported at the moment in this area, there is still a lack in the performance which can be improved by synchronization of their properties. In this PhD work, we present the preparation and full characterization of conductive polymer nanocomposites. Two kinds of conductive nanofillers (carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs)) have been dispersed either in a thermoplastic polymer (polyethylene PE), or in a thermoset matrix (epoxy amine). The conductive polymer nanocomposites obtained exhibit good electrical and\u002for thermal properties with conserving the mechanical properties ensured by low fillers fraction. The study was not only based on experimental characterizations but also on modulation to analyze the charge carrier transport at very low temperature in these systems to provide successful understanding to some basic properties which are still actually not fully investigated. Electrical properties are in good agreement with thermal properties. Electromagnetic shielding of our PE based nanocomposites have been studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).","Over the past 10 years, researchers have highlighted the role of biofilms on resistance to immune response and antibiotics treatments of chronic infections.Chronic wounds share these characteristics as they are resistant to care treatments. The possible biofilm formation in wound can protect bacteria participating to the chronicity and the resistance to wound care treatment. The aim of this thesis is to conceive a biogel against biofilms in chronic wounds.We have developed an innovative gelatin gel containing various anti-biofilm agents able to eradicate pathogenic bacteria biofilm. This gel is soft matter composed of a liquid phase entrapped in a biopolymer network. It is biocompatible and bioresorbable; these properties are necessary for a biomaterial. The gel has the capacity to deliver molecules with controlled release. We have studied the release of model molecules with different charges and weights.The anti-biofilm strategy consisted in preventing bacterial colonization, disrupting the biofilm and eradicating pathogen bacteria in wound (a decrease biomass of at least 5 log reductions). The system developed consisted in the combination of three different types of molecules: a commercial antiseptic usually applied in chronic wound care, an ion chelator active against MMPs which are over-expressed in chronic wounds and a protease which can disrupt the matrix of the biofilm.The study has been carried out on mono-species biofilms synthesized in vitro, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, two pathogenic bacteria frequently encountered in chronic wounds. The combination of the active agents was tested in solution or  in directly contact with the biofilm. Then molecules were entrapped in the biogel. The viscoelastic properties of the gel were studied and the efficacy of the entrapped treatment compared to that of the solution. A handeable and efficient biomaterial has been elaborated during this study. It is able to eradicate mono \u2013 and multi- species biofilms from both laboratory and clinical bacterial strains.","Mutations in genes coding for NER factors give rise to autosomal recessive diseases such as Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The phenotypes associated with these genetic syndromes spans from extreme sensitivity to UV light, with increased predisposition to cancer (for XP and combined XP\u002fCS, mostly), mental retardation and progeria (for CS and combined XP\u002fCS). Whether the correlation between defective DNA repair reactions and UV-sensitivity\u002fcancer may be more intuitive, a link with neurological\u002fprogeroid symptoms is still a matter of debate. As a possible explanation, it has been proposed a connection between NER and transcription regulation. We propose additional insights on XPG and XPC roles in transcription regulation in absence of exogenous stress and how CSA and CSB orchestrate transcription arrest due to genotoxic attack. XPC was able to stably interact with NSD3 methyltransferase. Mutations in XPC also disturbed the transcriptome and the H3K36me3 distribution. Mutations in XPG deregulate gene expression and XPG is able to be recruited genome wide together with TFIIH. CSA and CSB can, as part of the ubiquitin\u002fproteasome machinery, regulate the recruitment timing of DNA binding factors and control transcriptional program after UV irradiation. Hence, our data shed more light in NER factors role in transcription and their defective action as a cause of XP and XP\u002fCS disorders. Additionally, our data provide explanations on the mechanism of transcription arrest following genotoxic stress and pose questions about the origins of CS phenotype.","The alkali-silica reaction is an endogenous chemical reaction affecting concrete. Therefore, it is important to model the effects of the reaction so as to estimate the life span of the attacked structures. The reaction leads to a microscopic cracking, due to the pressure of the reaction products which swell by absorption of water, inducing swelling of the concrete. If the concrete is mechanically loaded, the orientation of the microscopic cracking is affected by the local stress state, which induces anisotropy of the mechanical properties and deformations of the concrete. Our work aims at simulating, starting from simple assumptions about the reaction mechanisms, and for a class of fast-reacting aggregates, the development of cracking at the microscopic scale, so as to estimate the deformations and mechanical properties of the attacked concrete. In this purpose, we use a micromechanical description of the concrete, thanks to which we can compute the mechanical properties and deformations from the state of cracking of the concrete. In addition to that, we use an energy fracture criterion to determine the evolution of cracking as the attack progresses. We tested our model on numerous cases. These tests show that this description is well adapted to studying alkali-silica reaction. The identification of the parameters using laboratory experiments yielded good results as far as compression stresses are below 10 MPa. However, the fracture energies identified are greater than accepted values for concretes. We think that our model overestimates the anisotropy of the reaction, which is balanced by higher fracture energies in the identification","The understanding of the electronic processes occurring during atomic and molecular collisions concerns the fundamental level but also the needs for quantitative information on these processes, requested by several fields of application, in particular medical physics and plasma physics. Our goal is to provide a better description of these processes. In the framework of the thesis, we have modelled the electronic processes taking place during the collisions between bare ions and the helium atom, Aq +-He (2\u2264q\u226410). This study is carried out in the range of intermediate energies (0.25-625 keV\u002fu), adopting the semi-classical non-perturbative close coupling approach. A particular interest is paid to the single and double capture processes because of their great importance in this energy range. More precisely, we have analysed the double capture processes, splitting the contributions of double capture to bound states and to auto-ionizing states. This latter is particularly complex to describe since it requires a good description of doubly-excited states (beyond the two first thresholds in our study), difficult to implement in time-dependent coupled-channel approaches as ours. By analysing the cross sections of these two processes for all the systems studied and comparing them to available experimental and theoretical data, we were able to extract a general behaviour linking the most favourable electronic processes to the projectile charge and velocity.","Within the general goal of reaching high operating temperature while maintaining strong requirements on infrared photodetector performances, the pressure on HgCdTe material quality is increasingly growing. In particular, careful attention is now being paid to stress and stress relaxation within HgCdTe photodiodes. While recent studies have focused on the lattice mismatch induced strain over areas in the order of the wafer, no experimental investigation has been able to resolve the strain at the micrometer level.The typical millimetric spatial resolution limit of standard diffraction can be overtaken using a focused synchrotron X-ray white beam. Indeed, by performing Laue microdiffraction measurements, we can map with a sub-micrometer resolution both the local deviatoric strain and lattice orientation. This thesis focuses on the analysis of etched trenches inside HgCdTe layers with variations on passivation and annealing steps. We are able to investigate a precise mapping around the etching and appreciate the local effects of the processing steps. Diffraction peak displacement mapping evidences bending of the crystal planes around etched trenches, with strong dependence upon the processing steps.Then, we focus on the relative position of all the peaks which are measured simultaneously. Assuming a bi-axial strain between layer and substrate, the slope of the peak relative displacement as a function of their position directly provides the strain value undergone by the material. Thus, we measure the strain through the entire sample with a precision of 3.10-5 and map it with a sub-micronic position precision.Finally, we show how the use of a three point calibrated bending set-up leads to the experimental determination of the plasticity threshold in HgCdTe\u002fCdZnTe epitaxial structures together with the spatial distribution of the applied strain. The dynamics from elastic to plastic regime and the layer behavior once the plastic threshold is reached are investigated. Furthermore, the etching step creates abrupt edges inside the layer, leading to a modification of the strain field by concentrating it on the angles of the trench.","Adaptive resource allocation in wireless communication systems is crucial in order to support the diverse QoS needs of the services and optimize resource utilization. The design of resource allocation schemes should consider the service type for which it is intended. Moreover, due to feedback delay and channel estimation error, the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reported to the transmitter may not be a perfect measure of the channel quality and its use for resource allocation may severely degrade the systems performance. In this thesis, we study resource allocation and CQI reporting for wireless networks while taking the aforementioned factors into consideration. First, we consider resource allocation and adaptive modulation in uplink SC-FDMA systems. This is a combinatorial problem whose optimal solution is exponentially complex. We use canonical duality theory to derive a polynomial complexity resource allocation algorithm that provides a nearly optimal solution to the problem. Then, we focus on resource allocation for video streaming in wireless networks with time-varying interference. To this end, by using risk-sensitive control approach, we develop a cross-layer optimization framework that performs power control at the PHY\u002fMAC layer and rate adaptation at the APPLICATION layer jointly and provides fairness among nodes. Finally, by using stochastic control and game theory, we design a robust best-M CQI reporting scheme for multi-carrier and multi-user systems which takes into account the impact of feedback delay and error in CQI computation. Performing resource allocation on the basis of the proposed CQI reporting can significantly improve the system performance.","The purpose of this PhD is to provide a Structural Alphabet (SA) for more accurate characterization of protein three-dimensional (3D) structures as well as integrating the increasing protein 3D structure information currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The SA also takes into consideration the logic behind the structural fragments sequence by using the hidden Markov Model (HMM). In this PhD, we describe a new structural alphabet, improving the existing HMM-SA27 structural alphabet, called SAFlex (Structural Alphabet Flexibility), in order to take into account the uncertainty of data (missing data in PDB files) and the redundancy of protein structures. The new SAFlex structural alphabet obtained therefore offers a new, rigorous and robust encoding model. This encoding takes into account the encoding uncertainty by providing three encoding options: the maximum a posteriori (MAP), the marginal posterior distribution (POST), and the effective number of letters at each given position (NEFF). SAFlex also provides and builds a consensus encoding from different replicates (multiple chains, monomers and several homomers) of a single protein. It thus allows the detection of structural variability between different chains. The methodological advances and the achievement of the SAFlex alphabet are the main contributions of this PhD. We also present the new PDB parser(SAFlex-PDB) and we demonstrate that our parser is therefore interesting both qualitative (detection of various errors) and quantitative terms (program optimization and parallelization) by comparing it with two other parsers well-known in the area of Bioinformatics (Biopython and BioJava). The SAFlex structural alphabet is being made available to the scientific community by providing a website. The SAFlex web server represents the concrete contribution of this PhD while the SAFlex-PDB parser represents an important contribution to the proper function of the proposed website. Here, we describe the functions and the interfaces of the SAFlex web server. The SAFlex can be used in various fashions for a protein tertiary structure of a given PDB format file; it can be used for encoding the 3D structure, identifying and predicting missing data. Hence, it is the only alphabet able to encode and predict the missing data in a 3D protein structure to date. Finally, these improvements; are promising to explore increasing protein redundancy data and obtain useful quantification of their flexibility","A novel thermal approach to treat non-invasively incompetent veins with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is presented in this thesis.The ability to occlude small veins was first investigated. Two different sonication procedures were evaluated by numerical simulations and tested in vivo on rabbit veins. The histologic examination of the treated veins demonstrated the efficacy of the treatments, especially when the vein was compressed during ultrasonic exposures.A new procedure was then designed in order to coagulate larger veins, closer to human vein diameters. Experimental temperature measurements at the vein wall during HIFU pulses were used as inputs to determine numerically the optimum spacing between the pulses in order to induce a continuous coagulation along the vein. Acute animal trials on sheep veins were conducted to quantify tissue damages following such treatments. Finally, chronic studies up to 90 days were conducted on sheep in order to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of our treatment procedure. The histological findings validated the performance and safety of our HIFU thermal method, in a sheep model. From a pathology standpoint, the HIFU lesions are similar to those observed after radiofrequency ablation (an endovenous thermal modality used for the treatment of varicose veins).The results presented in this thesis allowed Theraclion to get the authorization to conduct first-in-human clinical trials for varicose vein treatments. The results were very encouraging and led to the CE-marking of the HIFU system.","The recycling of asphalt mixtures manufactured with a warm process meets the requirements of sustainable development: it limits the use of new materials, allows waste management and reduces energy consumption. The recycling of asphalt mixtures dates from the 70's. What has changed since that is the will to sustain high rate recycling, defined here by more than 25% of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). RAP contains a part of bitumen that is recoverable for its viscoelastic properties of asphalt binder. It is thus desired to mobilize this aged binder in the recycling process. One of the suspected problems when coupling recycling and warm process is the phenomenon of double coating that could affect rheological properties of the new material: the RAP binder and the new binder do not would mix completely due to the reduction of processing temperatures and would form superimposed layers. This phenomenon would cause mechanical dysfunctions in the asphalt mixture. This raises the question of the quality of the coating of granular surfaces, previously coated, and lack of characterization tools for in situ observation of the interface. In this thesis work, the quality of coating of RAP by a new binder has been evaluated at the microscopic and macroscopic scales. At the microscopic level, it has been proposed to use infrared micro-spectroscopy tool to evaluate the quality of interface between the RAP and the new binder and to follow the spatial distribution of these two components within mixtures produced in laboratory. To do that, it has been necessary to carry out an important experimental development in order to apply an infrared imaging accessory to complex mixtures that are the bituminous mixtures made of different granular fractions and bituminous binder. It was then possible, based on previous identification of internal tracers, to follow the partial remobilization of RAP aging binder. In parallel, at the macroscopic level, a testing protocol has been developed to evaluate the durability of high rate recycled asphalt mixtures (50% of RAP), including mixes produced in a warm process. The current fatigue test is one of the tests that best evaluate the lifetime of a pavement layer. But this accelerated test is biased because the bitumen of the mixtures tested did not have time to aged, as occurs in the case on a real road. In this work, it was proposed to add an aging step of the material before fatigue test, rutting test, modulus test and moisture damage test. It is assumed that the real behavior of the material would range between that of the unaged material and that of aged material. The main obtained results show that warm mixture asphalt containing high rate of RAP exhibit good mechanical performance, with a trend to be more susceptible to fatigue than a similar hot mixture or a warm mixture without added RAP.","During this study, in a first top-down approach, we investigated evaporated multilayer organic solar cells built from pentacene and PTCDI-C5. We studied spectral response from these materials as well as their vacuum deposition characteristics. We used that knowledge to build simple junction and bi-layer solar cells. Those cells were the reference that allowed us to build and characterised multijonctions bi-layer solar cells with a nanostructured silver layer as recombination layer. A simple study of that silver layer was also conducted. We then switched to self-assembled monolayers on silicon in order to build donor-acceptor active layers that could be stacked, in a bottom-up approach. First, we compared silane and phosphonic acid grafting groups with an 18 carbon long alkane chain. Then we studied (3- trimethoxysilylpropyl) diethylentrimaine (DETAS) on silicon with extra care on relative humidity as a grafting parameter. We also investigated DETAS SAM to highlight hydrogen bonding within the monolayer using ATR-FTIR. DETAS SAM were then used as an anchor molecule for a photoactive molecule perylene tetracarboxylicdianhydrid (PTCDA). Characterisation technics used were AFM, ellipsometry, and Raman spectroscopy","Venus is quite similar to Earth in terms of mass and radius, but it appears to be a hellish planetwith surface temperature reaching 700 K and pressions up to 92 bars. The atmosphere is mostlycomposed of carbon dioxyde and despite a slow retrograde rotating solid body, the atmosphereis in superrotation with a period of about four days and zonal winds reaching 100 m\u002fs at cloudtop level. In visible light, the surface is always hidden by thick decks of clouds mostly madeof sulfuric acid. These clouds are very important in venusian climate as they play a key role inthe radiative balance of the planet because of their opacity and their high albedo and also in thechemical cycles of sulfur especially.In orbit since 2006, the European space agency\u2019s probe Venus Express had the objective tostudy the atmosphere and clouds of Venus. Amongst its instruments was the SPICAV spectrometerwhich infrared channel had the ability to measure the degree of linear polarisation fromthe light scattered by the clouds. This thesis aims to study these observations acquired by SPICAVIRuntil the end of the mission in 2014.We will introduce the planet Venus with a particular focuson the cloud layers. We will then cover the principles of the polarisation of light through scatteringby cloud particles before we introduce the measurement of polarization by our instrument.We also introduce the radiative transfer model taking into account polarization and apply it tothe observations of a phenomenon called glory which allows to characterize the properties of thecloud droplets. We will then invesigate the variability of the haze layers lying above the maincloud deck.","In last decades, male fertility has been steadily declining worldwide. Even if environmental factors have an undeniable responsibility, the fact remains that both genetic and epigenetic alterations also seem to be widely implicated. The understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate male fertility is recent but essential to develop a new therapeutic approaches. In this context, the objective of my thesis work focused on the study of the role of histone variant H3.3 in spermatogenesis. H3.3 has the ability to replace the H3 canonical histone in chromatin thus modifying the epigenetic properties of chromatin. H3.3 is necessary for spermatogenesis but its role remains unclear. Used to several mouse models, my thesis work has shown that the H3.3B form is essential for male reproduction and especially for the meiosis\u002fpost-meiosis transition. During this transition, there is a strong regulation of piRNAs, retrotransposons and sex chromosomes. Our experiments reveal at the first time that the loss of H3.3B resulted in down-regulation of the expression of piRNA. In contrast, the absence of H3.3B is also associated with increased expression of all sex chromosom genes as well as of both RLTR10B and RLTR10B2 retrotransposons. These expression changes result in altered spermatogenesis and infertility. By ChIP-seq experiments, we observed that H3.3 is markedly enriched on the piRNA clusters, RLTR10B and RLTR10B2 retrotransposons and the whole sexual chromosomes. All these experiments allowed bettering characterizing the regulatory function of histone H3.3B during spermatogenesis. In particular, he demonstrates that H3.3B, depending on its chromatin localization, is involved in either up-regulation or down-regulation of expression of defined chromatin regions. These results show the importance of epigenetic controls during spermatogenesis and open new tracks for understanding the causes of male infertility.","DIAM Bouchage develops composites from cork flour and binder in order to produce technological cork-stoppers carried out by a molding process. To get rid of the use of isocyanates for polyurethanes synthesis, new pathways for 100% biobased polymers without the use of CMR substances are considered. As the most promising route for Non-Isocyanate PolyUrethanes (NIPUs) synthesis, Polyhydroxyurethanes (PHUs) have been chosen. The presented study concerns the synthesis, the characterization and the formulation of a new PHU binder from cyclocarbonates and amines.Among available biobased reactants and synthetic pathways, few monomers have been selected in accordance with specifications. This has led to PHUs materials and cork-stoppers development to identify the best formulations. New hybrids routes have finally been developed to overcome PHUs limitations such as reactivity and conversion. Acrylates have been used as reactive additives or cross-linkers for PHU-amino telechelic prepolymers. New cyclic carbonates monomers of low viscosity and high functionality have also been synthesized to solve process issues.","The organ maturation, changes in body composition and ontogeny of metabolising enzymes and transporters are responsible for the developmental changes of pharmacokinetics in children. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the different steps of the pharmacokinetic studies in children (requirements, conduction and data analysis). The results will optimise drug use including therapeutic drug monitoring. The thesis includes studies concerning these different steps illustrated by examples 1) analytical requirements were demonstrated by the development of a highly sensitive analytical method of ciprofloxacin with micro-HPLC-MS, 2) the conduct and data analysis of classical pharmacokinetic studies were demonstrated with the example of antiretroviral drugs in HIV infected children, 3) the conduct and data analysis of population pharmacokinetic studies were illustrated by the use of immunosuppressants in renal transplant children. In addition, integration of pharmacogenetic variability was included in these studies. 4) the importance of population pharmacokinetic modelling for therapeutic drug monitoring was also demonstrated with two drugs frequently used in nephrology which are mycophenolate mofetil in patients with nephrotic syndrome and valganciclovir in cytomegalovirus infected patients. The thesis illustrates the different aspects of pharmacokinetic studies and primarily, modelisation in order to describe and explain pharmacokinetic variability in children and then optimise monitoring","The view of plastic food packaging turned from useful to a major source of contaminants in food and an environmental threat. Substituting glass by recycled or biosourced plastic containers reduces environmental impacts for bottled beverages. The thesis developed a 3D computational and optimization framework to accelerate the prototyping of eco-efficient packaging for alcoholic beverages. Shelf-life, food safety, mechanical constraints, and packaging wastes are considered into a single multicriteria optimization problem. New bottles are virtually generated within an iterative three steps process involving: i) a multiresolution [E]valuation of coupled mass transfer; ii) a [D]ecision step validating technical (shape, capacity, weight) and regulatory (shelf-life, migrations) constraints; iii) a global [Solving] step seeking acceptable Pareto solutions. The capacity to predict shelf-life of liquors in real conditions was tested successfully on ca. 500 hundred bottle min iatures in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) over several months. The entire approach has been designed to manage any coupled mass transfer (permeation, sorption, migration). Mutual sorption is considered via polynary Flory-Huggins formulation. A blob formulation of the free-volume theory of Vrentas and Duda was developed to predict the diffusion properties in glassy polymers of water and organic solutes in arbitrary polymers (polyesters, polyamides, polyvinyls, polyolefins). The validation set included 433 experimental diffusivities from literature and measured in this work. The contribution of polymer relaxation in glassy PET was analyzed in binary and ternary differential sorption using a cosorption microbalance from 25 to 50\u00b0C. Part of the framework will be released as an open-source project to encourage the integration of more factors affecting the shelf-life of beverages and food products (oxidation kinetics, aroma scalping).","An increasing number of vaccine strategies against HIV are based on viral vectors. Most advanced stategies have used adenovirus or poxvirus vectors with mixed success, but a vaccine capable of preventing the infection remains elusive. We generated a replicating chimeric measles virus in which the hemagglutinin and fusion surface glycoproteins were replaced with the gp160 envelope glycoprotein of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239). Based on a previously cloned live-attenuated Schwarz vaccine strain of measles virus (MV), this chimera was rescued at high titers using reverse genetics in CD4+target cells. Cytopathic effect consisted in the presence of large cell aggregates evolving fo form syncytia, as observed during SIV infection. The morphology of the chimeric virus was identical to that of the parent MV particles. The presence of SIV gp160 as the only envelope protein on chimeric particles surface altered the cell tropism of the new virus from CD46+ to CD4+ cells. Used as an HIV candidate vaccine, this MV\u002fSIVenv chimeric virus would mimic transient HIV-like infection, benefiting both from HIV-like tropism and the capacity of MV to replicate in dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes.","The discovery of new antibiotics is an important challenge in current medicinal chemistry. Due to the increasing multidrug resistance to current antibacterial therapies, it is urgent to discover new targets for innovative antibiotic strategies. Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are small genetic elements composed of a toxin gene and its cognate antitoxin that play a pivotal role in the survival of bacterial cells. Under normal conditions of bacterial growth, antitoxins strongly inhibit toxins\u2019 synthesis. Under stress conditions, such as during antibiotic treatment, antitoxin RNAs are degraded thus release toxins which are proteins that induce the inhibition of vital cellular processes and bacterial cell death. Recent studies on the ability of toxin-antitoxin systems to regulate bacterial cell death make them a starting point for the development of potent and new antimicrobial agents. In this manuscript, we focus on type I toxin-antitoxin systems that consist of an antitoxin RNA interacting with the toxin-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) in Helicobacter pylori bacteria. This toxin-antitoxin system could represent a new target for molecules able to inhibit the complex formation between toxin and antitoxin RNAs could activate the toxin synthesis by messenger RNA translation leading thus the death of the bacterial cells. To validate this toxin-antitoxin system as a target of choice, we prepared several series of RNA ligands designed to interact with the toxin-antitoxin type I RNAs. This work describes their design and synthesis as well as their biochemical (dissociation constant: KD, complex inhibition) and biological (antibacterial cellular activity) evaluations. Validation of this promising strategy could help to develop new antibiotics to overcome a current major therapeutic issue: multidrug resistance of bacteria to known antibiotic treatments.","The application of sustainable water management is vital for all industrial sectors, especially the food industry, one of the most water-consuming sectors. It can be managed by optimizing water reuse, regeneration, and recycling to optimize the production costs and reduce the environmental impacts. Using classical mass integration methods can help to reduce water consumption and wastewater production. Implementing these methods in the food sector faces various challenges, such as the lack of water and wastewater volume in different operations and the data related to pollutant indicators. As a variation of energy pinch, water pinch analysis is a comprehensive and systematic approach that tries to minimize water consummation and wastewater production. This classic method is suitable for mono-contaminant systems. \tHowever, most industrial systems are complex and involve multiple contaminants, especially in the food sector. The classic methods are not able to deal with these kinds of problems. Using numerical optimization tools by inspiring water pinch logic is a suitable approach to handling real and complex water networks.Two numerical tools based on the logic of water pinch analysis are developed. The first tool is based on a manual optimization approach assisted by numerical algorithms. The second tool is based on constrained multi-objective optimization. These two tools are developed to handle real and complex industrial water systems that contain multiple contaminants. The designed approaches lead to target the minimum freshwater by using the maximum possibility of reuse. A French edible oil company has been selected as the real industrial application of the developed tools.","SEPROSYS company is specialized in the development of processes for the extraction, separation, and purification of molecules of interest. In 2011, the company developed an innovative and eco-compatible process for the separation and fractional purification of biomolecules from marine macroalgae. The aim of this thesis is to identify potentially applications for the different fractions extracted using the process developed by SEPROSYS, and in particular, in two distinct fields: in dermocosmetic for anti-aging and anti-stain activity, and in nutraceutical for anti-inflammatory activity. The first part concerns the improvement of the process, the characterization of protein fractions as well as the production of peptide and oligosaccharide fractions from Ulva rigida and Ulva intestinalis. The second part is devoted to the evaluation of the \"anti-aging\" and \"anti-stain\" potential of the different fractions from Ulva rigida and Ulva intestinalis. Thus, the impact of our fractions on the biosynthesis of collagen and hyaluronic acid from fibroblast lines were studies, as well as the effect of the fractions on the in vitro production of melanin by murine melanocytes. In addition, the aim of this work is also to better understand the structure-function relationship of the anti-aging activity of protein fractions. The third part concerns a project called Neuronalg, whose objective is the development of algo-sourced nutritional actives, targeting inflammation and mechanisms of alterations in emotional behaviour linked to metabolic disorders. This will be achieved through the anti-inflammatory activities of fractions on mouse macrophages through the quantification of nitric oxide produced, associated with the transcription level of target proteins such as iNOS (inducible NO synthase) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.","The purpose of this thesis was to explore the surface chemistry of platinum-zinc bimetallic systems, and their catalytic activity in the oxidation reaction of CO. The research on this bimetallic system was carried out on two fronts: a surface science study of the model system, a discontinuous ZnO single layer epitaxied on Pt(111), using scanning tunneling microscopy and synchrotron radiation near ambien pressure x-ray photoemission, and a more \u201cnanomaterial science\u201d oriented study of the same bi-metallic system, using complex colloidal synthesis chemistry, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and finally laboratory XPS. First, a model surface consisting of a ZnO monolayer film supported on Pt(111) was fabricated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Its surface chemistry was explored by STM and then by synchrotron radiation NAP-XPS under operando conditions. We were able to prove that this system was indeed a typical case of inverse catalysis. Synergetic effects due to the presence of both materials were well seen, but only at low temperatures (up to 410 K). Beyond that temperature, mass transport effects prevent the reactivity of the ZnO\u002fPt(111) and Pt(111) surfaces from being compared. We have shown that reaction intermediates must be formed in the border area between ZnO and platinum, when the ZnO film is discontinuous. We have highlighted the key role played by the hydroxyls present only ion the ZnO patches, which are due to the dissociation of H2 or H2O from the residual atmosphere on the platinum patches. In particular, we have detected by NAP-XPS the presence of a carboxyl species (due to the association of OH with CO), which precedes the desorption of CO2. Above 410 K, a formate appears, and the latter species is likely a spectator in the CO oxidation process. The transfer of the knowledge accumulated in the preceding surface science and model catalysts studies, to the more realistic case of nanocrystals of the PtZn alloy, while it helped identify some common phenomena, it also shows its limitations. In fact the NC coated with their oleylamine ligands have characteristics that UHV model surfaces do not possess, due to the NC fabrication process itself: we have found spectroscopic hints of the presence of water (possibly a byproduct of the reaction, arising from a condensation reaction between the ketone and the amine); in addition, a capping of the platinum surface by H atoms, is, at present, explanatory of many observed phenomena. Finding the experimental conditions to produce bimetallic nano-alloys from two metal-acac2 precursors was a daunting task, much more than that of physically depositing a thin film on a UHV monocrystal. Our efforts were rewarded as we were able to produce PtZn alloy NCs. This one of the main points of the present study. The presence of Pt(acac)2 prevents zinc (whose from being fully oxidized to ZnO, which is the case when Zn(acac)2 alone is present in oleylamine. Monochromatized XPS shows that zinc makes an alloy with platinum, where it remains metallic, while another fraction is under the form of ZnO. It is not completely clear whether two reaction channels are in competion (PtZn alloying versus Zn oxidation by water), or Zn is oxidized afterwards, i.e. after exposure to air. The alloyed NCs have been studied in detail by advanced methods of electron microscopy (including under operando conditions), diffraction and EDS. Unlike the case of the surface model where the STM images were particularly telling, we do not have at this stage of the study an exact model of the interface between the metal alloy and the zinc oxide that surrounds it. On the other hand, we know that the core of the NCs is occupied by the PtZn alloy, and that the outer planes are identical to those of pure platinum. [...]","Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) are attractive alternatives of pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers (pMDI) in pulmonary delivery, thanks to its being free of CFC and ease of use. The typical size of respirable drug particles is generally less than 5 micrometers. Formulations with fine drug particles and coarse carrier particles, usually lactose have been commonly used to facilitate dispersion and flow. Nevertheless, DPI formulation and production require an adequate optimization in order to de-agglomerate the cohesive drug particles and to produce a uniform mixture with a coarser carrier. Furthermore, improvement of the aerodynamic performance of drug mixtures has recently drawn the great attention of pharmaceutical company. Indeed, the close control of drug and carrier physicochemical properties is crucial to obtain and to maintain the quality of formulation during development and manufacturing. In this study, lactose alpha monohydrate was used as carrier. Different grades and qualities of lactose were compared. Fluticasone propionate and terbutaline sulphate served as model drug. Different techniques were used to characterize the properties of drug and carrier: particle size distribution (by laser diffraction), thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), image analysis by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), and surface energy by inverse gas chromatography (iGC)... Drug and carrier were mixed by low-shear tumble blending mixer, the influence of operating conditions was studied. The aerodynamic performance of drug mixtures was determined by Twin Stage Impinger (European Pharmacopoeia). Several novel techniques were developed during this study in order to characterize drug mixtures. Drug \u2013 carrier adhesion was quantified by Alpine Air jet Siever. Powder permeability was measured by permeametry with the Blaine apparatus. Agglomerate size of drug in mixture was also determined by method developed based on laser diffraction in liquid. The rheological properties of powder were determined by Freeman FT4, a new powder rheometer. Carrier particle size plays an important role on the inhalation performance of interactive mixture. Decrease in carrier particle size leads to a decrease of particulate interaction between drug and carrier. The reduced adhesion between drug and carrier particles increased drug detachment, and thus increased the respirable fraction of drug. Different batches of lactose with similar particle size but different production method (milling or sieving) were investigated. Among the parameters tested, the differences are the preparation processes and the content of fine lactose particles. Lactose obtained by milling process shows a higher adsorption potential measured by iGC and it contains more fine particles which could form agglomerates with the drug. Because of their increased detachment mass, drug particles may be more easily detached from the coarse lactose in the air flow. With higher FPF values, which correspond to higher fines content, the peak maxima determined by IGC are shifted to higher adsorption potentials which support the agglomeration hypothesis. [...]","Oil-in-water nanoemulsions can be used as drug delivery systems for the encapsulation of hydrophobic active substances in order to increase their solubility and their bioavailability. However, due to their higher specific area, their stabilization requires higher surfactant concentrations compared to conventional emulsions. Most of the synthetic surfactants commonly used in emulsion formulation are potentially irritant and even toxic, which hinders the therapeutic application of nanoemulsions especially during long-term treatment. The objective of this thesis is thus to formulate pharmaceutical oil\u002fwater nanoemulsions stabilized by a biopolymer, beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg), instead of synthetic surfactants. Nanoemulsions were prepared by high pressure homogenization (HPH). The formulation composition and the process conditions were optimized in order to obtain nanometric droplets within stable nanoemulsions. The results showed that the most stable nanoemulsions, with droplet size inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 200 nm, were obtained when 5 w\u002fw% of the oil with the lowest viscosity value was used as the oily phase, 95 w\u002fw% of beta-lg solution at a concentration of 1 w\u002fw% was used as the aqueous phase, and 100 MPa of homogenization pressure was applied for 4 cycles. This formulation was stable against droplet growth phenomena during 30 days at least, thanks to a quasi purely elastic interfacial film. Xanthan gum, a natural polysaccharide, was added to the optimal formulation as a texturizing agent at a concentration of 0.5 w\u002fw%. This allowed obtaining a cream texture with a shear thinning behavior. In this formulation, the migration rate of droplets was considerably reduced and the nanoemulsions stability was enhanced.The effects of the homogenization process on the different levels of the protein structure were assessed by spectroscopic, chromatographic and electrophoretic methods. The influence of this treatment on its interfacial and emulsifying properties was also investigated. The optimal emulsifying efficiency was obtained when the homogenization conditions did alter neither the structure of beta-lg nor its interfacial properties. However, an excessive HPH treatment (300 MPa\u002f5 cycles) introduced structural modifications, mainly from beta-sheets into random coils, wide loss in lipocalin core, and protein aggregation by intermolecular disulfide bridges. HPH modified beta-lg displayed higher surface hydrophobicity inducing a higher adsorption rate at the O\u002fW interface and an earlier formation of an elastic interfacial film. Structural and interfacial properties modifications by HPH denaturation appeared qualitatively similar to that of the heat denaturation with, however, differences in extent. Protein denaturation by a high pressure treatment that was performed before the emulsification process did not alter significantly its emulsifying efficiency. The reduction in the efficiency was rather induced by the simultaneous denaturation with the emulsification under high turbulent flow.The efficiency of the developed formulation as a vehicle for a model hydrophobic active substance was studied using isotretinoin, usually used for the treatment of severe acne. The developed formulation was able to encapsulate 0.033 w\u002fw of isotretinoin without any modification on the system stability. About 10 % of the added isotretinoin was solubilized in the aqueous phase associated with the free protein in excess. Isotretinoin encapsulated in the oily droplets was more stable against photo isomerization than the one associated to the excess protein in the aqueous phase. The developed formulation seems promising as a drug delivery system of isotretinoin for a dermal application.","Ethylene glycol method allowed to obtain Au:Co and Au:Ni nanoalloys. It was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, where a slight shift of the main diffraction signal towards larger angles was observed due to the contraction of the interplanar distance of gold because of the insertion of smaller atoms. The conditions used in the present work, however, were not ideal since by not adjusting the pH to basic values, the formation of Co and Ni ethylene-glycoxides was not allowed, species that facilitate the reduction of metals; furthermore, at the working pH, the decomposition of the reducing agent, NaBH4, can occur. With transmission electron microscopy, it was observed that, by increasing the volume of the precursor solutions of Co and Ni, the particle size decreased, this because the concentration of Au decreased. Additionally, XPS confirmed the formation of the Au:Ni\u002fC 94:6 nanoalloy since the peaks corresponding to Au 4f5\u002f2 and Au 4f7\u002f2 core levels shifted towards lower binding energies compared to the pure Au prepared in this work.The characterization of nanoalloys Au:Fe, Au:Co, and Au:Ni prepared by the stirring method in aqueous medium at room temperature was continued. By adjusting the pH of the solution to 10, the precipitation of transition metal hydroxides was observed. By X-ray diffraction, it was corroborated that the main diffraction signals shifted towards greater angles in 2\u03b8, the above indicates the alloy between metals. This displacement occurred in a greater way for Au:Co and Au:Ni than for Au:Fe, this phenomena can be explained since Au, Co, and Ni share the same face-centered cubic crystal structure (FCC), while Fe has a body-centered cubic crystal structure (BCC).. TEM and X-EDS techniques allowed to observe that particles obtained by the stirring method were smaller and less agglomerated than those obtained by the ethylene glycol method. However, the atomic distribution was not homogeneous: Au-rich, Co-rich, and Ni-rich zones were observed.By observing that aqueous medium allowed to obtain smaller and less agglomerated particles, it was decided to perform the characterization of Au:Fe, Au:Co, and Au:Ni prepared by hydrothermal method. With X-ray diffraction it was observed the same two phenomena above. Other phenomenon observed by XRD was that Au diffraction signals decreased in intensity, pointing to a decrease of its crystallinity due to the alloy with the transition metals. The particle sizes of Au:Co and Au:Ni were smaller compared with the two previous methods, the aforesaid corroborated by TEM. Elemental analysis by X-EDS evidenced the formation of Au-rich, Co-rich, and Ni-rich zones. With XPS, it was observed the negative shift in the binding energies of the Au 4f5\u002f2 and Au 4 f7\u002f2 core levels of Au after alloying it with Fe, Co, and Ni. It has been proven that the above shift produces a change in the center of the d-band concerning the Fermi Level, which favors the adsorption of O2 on the Au surface. The rotating ring-disk electrode technique allowed to demonstrate that, by alloying Au with metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni by hydrothermal method, its electrocatalytic activity for the ORR increases in alkaline electrolyte, thus fulfilling the hypothesis of this work","In the current context of the reduction of pesticide use, soilborne pests and diseases, and especially the fungi Sclerotinia and the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne, become more and more worrying in vegetable production under shelter in Southern France. Alternative techniques exist, but their partial and varying efficiencies require the search for new strategies of management of these pests and diseases fit for producers.Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the benefit of combinations of two techniques, soil solarisation and green manure (Sorghum sudanense). It is also to determine the influences of crop successions and frequences of these techniques on their individual efficiencies.To this effect, a setup of producers' plots has been designed. The spatiotemporal evolution of incidences and severities of Sclerotinia and Meloidogyne in several cropping systems has been observed on this setup.The presence of a melon crop has a major influence on the efficiency of the alternative techniques. Opposite effects for the two considered pests and diseases appeared. Crops successions with melon are most favourable to highest infestations of Meloidogyne whereas, Sclerotinia infections are reduced. For this pathogen, a solarisation every year or every two years ensures the most effective control. On the contrary, in the case of Meloidogyne, the melon crop is very sensitive to this pest, a characteristic that masks the positive effects of alternative techniques.","Free space optical communications are able to allow rates of several tens of gigabits\u002fs. In order to process these flows and benefit from the techniques developed in the context of fiber optics, it is desirable to inject the received beam into a single mode fiber. In this case, adaptive optics is proposed to limit the injection losses induced by the degradation of the beam quality caused by the atmospheric turbulence.In this thesis, we consider a link between a satellite and a ground receiving station.For high elevations when amplitude perturbations can be averaged by increasing the size of the pupil and the correction of the phase is sufficient by conventional adaptive optics (AO), this work deals with the experimental implementation of the coupling optimization between a conventional AO and a single mode fiber, by correcting the non common path aberrations between the measurement path of the wave front and the injection path of the corrected signal. The accomplished work in this context is summarized by the following tasks: definition of an automatic injection optimization method by controlling a single deformable mirror for the parallel correction of fast phase disturbance and quasi-static differential aberrations; numerical study of the implementation of the proposed method defined end-to-end simulations ; implementation of the method in the laboratory on the BOA bench, modeling the atmospheric turbulence by rotating phase screens, and validation of the injection optimization in closed loop ; application of the method on the ODISSEE bench at the OCA and closing of the loop on a laser signal emitted by the Japanese satellite SOCRATE.Besides, the link must be operational for a maximum duration. Indeed, the system must operate even when the satellite is low on the horizon and, therefore, when the crossed portion of atmosphere is thick. In these particular conditions, the disturbances induced by the air index fluctuations are stronger than for astronomical observations, so that, the simultaneous correction of the phase and the amplitude is essential to reach the desired injection ratio (\u003e 50 %). Based on this analysis, the second part of this thesis focuses on the study of the experimental implementation of an innovative approach of a phase and amplitude correction based on using an integrated Mach-Zehnder. The work done in this part consists in the following points : elaboration of correction principle by a Mach-Zehnder and proposition of a generalized device with N channels ; theoretical analysis of the superposition by the proposed device ; development of a control algorithm based on the architecture proposed in integrated optics ; numerical validation of operation by end-to-end simulations ; design of the prototype for the experimental validation of the concept in the laboratory.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with a gradual increase in the expression of inhibitory molecules including IL-10, PD-L1 and IDO essentially by antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs). These molecules act negatively on the anti-HIV immune response and are associated with viral persistence and disease progression towards AIDS. One of the viral protein involved in this mechanism is Tat. In HIV-1 infected patients, Tat is secreted in the sera at nanomolar levels. In addition to its role in viral cycle, Tat interacts with immune cells to modulate the expression of many host genes including immunosuppressive factors. Previous work from our laboratory have shown that Tat protein, by acting at the membrane level, via its 1-45 N-terminal domain, stimulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, and immunosuppressive IL-10 production in human monocytes and macrophages. More recently, we have shown the involvement of TLR4\u002fMD2 in the interaction with Tat. Aim of the study: The objective of my thesis was to 1) Further characterize the implication of TLR4\u002fMD2 as potential receptor of Tat protein. To this end mouse models invalidated (KO) for TLR4 or its molecular partners (CD14, MD2, MyD88, TRIF) were used 2) Study the effect of Tat protein and its interaction with TLR4\u002fMD2 on the modulation of DCs functions including cytokine production, maturation, and the expression of immunosuppressive factors and their effects on the stimulation or inhibition of T cells activation. Results: The use of knockout mouse models has allowed us to confirm the central role of TLR4\u002fMD2 as receptor for Tat protein and to better understand the signalling pathways recruited by Tat to stimulate the production of IL-10 and TNF-a. Our results showed the importance of CD14 and MD2 in addition to TLR4 and demonstrated that Tat activates both TRIF and MyD88-dependent pathways. In parallel, the study of the effects of Tat-TLR4 interaction on the modulation of the immune response of DCs allowed us to show that i) Tat induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-a and IFN-? in addition to IL-10 and TNF-a ii) Tat induces the maturation of DCs by increasing the expression of CD83, CD80, CD86 and iii) Tat stimulates the expression of immunosuppressive factors IL-10, PD-L1 and IDO in association with the inhibition of T cells proliferation. Iv) All these effects were abolished or inhibited following the blockade of Tat-TLR4 interaction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HIV-1 by its Tat protein hijacks TLR4 pathway in APCs to induce the production of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors which are associated with the impairment of immune functions. It is therefore possible that, because of its early expression, Tat may help to establish an immunosuppressive state early after infection and thus contributed in the weakening of the immune system and viral persistence.","The Ruddlesden Popper RExA2-xMnO4 (RE: La, Nd and A: Sr, Ca) have been studied as electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. The LaxSr2-xMnO4\u00b1\u03b4 (x=0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6), NdxSr2-xMnO4\u00b1\u03b4 (x=0.4, 0.5) and NdxCa2-xMnO4\u00b1\u03b4 (x=0.25, 0.4, 0.5) were successfully synthesized. The RExSr2-xMnO4\u00b1\u03b4 materials (RE: La, Nd) are stable in reducing atmosphere with electrolyte-compatible TECs. In situ HT-NPD of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4\u00b1\u03b4 (L5S15M), under flowing hydrogen, reveals formation of oxide-ion vacancies on the equatorial sites of the perovskite layer. High electrical conductivities were obtained (35.6 S cm\u22121 in air and 1.9 S cm\u22121 in H2\u002fAr). Electrochemical properties of L5S15M electrode were investigated by EIS. The influence of both sintering temperature and electrode composition on the electrochemical performance was studied in both cathode and anode atmosphere. For oxygen reduction, the electron transfer between the electrode and oxygen, and the incorporation of oxygen ions into the electrode are the main rate-limiting steps. Increasing the sintering temperature to 1250\u00b0C leads to Sr accumulation at the GDC\u002fYSZ interface. For hydrogen oxidation, charge transfer at the electrode\u002felectrolyte interface, dissociative adsorption and surface diffusion were the limiting steps. The best compromise between sintering temperature and composition is reached for pure L5S15M electrode sintered at 1150 \u00b0C. Finally, the results extracted from EIS measurements allowed understanding the nature of processes taking place within the electrode, proposing that the electrochemical behavior of L5S15M could be improved with modification of the electrode\u2019s surface.","This study relates to the field of optical transmission systems fibers and more particularly the impact of different filtering techniques (optical) on the performance of optical transmission systems (metro access). Reception, these systems have a narrow filter, which filters the signal without having to deal with the noise in the link. It is generally considered that the narrowness of the receiving filter is indispensable for the proper functioning of a link without repeaters, and the sensitivity of the link is even greater than the width of the filter is close to the theoretical limit that is the spectrum width of the transmitted signal. The use of such filters has constraints. Firstly, the filters have steep slopes, and are expensive. On the other hand, a shift of the wavelength of the emitter length is always possible, so that most of the receivers comprise receiving filters whose wavelength is locked to the wavelength of the transmitter. For a transmission system with wavelength multiplexing, wherein plural different wavelengths may be used, this allows to increase the capacity of information transmitted, but however poses real constraints such that crosstalk between channels. The channels are multiplexed in the same fiber and filtered upon receipt by an optical filter which is used both in the channels and demultiplexing a possible optical filter in the spectrum of the considered channel. The optical filter has variable parameters: shape, bandwidth, and center wavelength, then the channel will be filtered and analyzed by the receiver. It includes a photodiode followed by an electrical filter of the form of the filter function of order Bessel type 5. Quality information will be evaluated by the bit error rate BER.In this thesis we propose to analyze the impact of the fundamental parameters of the filters on the performance of an optical system.","Interactions between genetic and environmental factors like exposure to stress play an important role in the pathogenesis of mood-related psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder. The polyspecific organic cation transporters (OCTs) were shown previously to be sensitive to the stress hormone corticosterone in vitro, suggesting these transporters might play a physiological role in the response to stress. During my PhD thesis I investigated the role of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) during stress and vulnerability to depression. OCT2 is expressed in several stress-related circuits in the brain and along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Genetic deletion of OCT2 in mice enhanced hormonal response to acute stress (156%) without altering adrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). As a consequence, OCT2-\u002f- mice were potently more sensitive to the action of unpredictable chronic mild stress and developed a transient aggravation of depression-related behaviors involving spatial memory and social interaction. We showed that the functional state of the glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) signaling pathway, highly responsive to acute stress, was altered in the hippocampus of OCT2-\u002f- mice. In vivo pharmacology and Western blot experiments argue for increased serotonin tonus as a main mechanism for impaired GSK3\u03b2 signaling in OCT2-\u002f- mice brain during acute response to stress. Our findings identify OCT2 as an important determinant of the response to stress in the brain, suggesting that in man OCT2 mutations or blockade by certain therapeutic drugs could interfere with HPA axis function and enhance vulnerability to repeated adverse events leading to stress-related disorders.","Clouds play a major role in Earth radiation budget and balance. The characterization of clouds in weather and climate models needs better understanding of cloud processes and more information on cloud microphysical properties. Such information can be obtained from active sensors like radar and lidar onboard CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites which are part of the A-Train constellation. The purpose of this thesis is first to improve and study the DARDAR method which provides cloud microphysical properties from variational scheme. Secondly this thesis deals with the adaptation of the method to the EarthCARE mission, which will, in 2016, board a lidar with high spectral resolution capabilities and a Doppler radar. The method for hydrometeors classification, DARDAR-MASK, was improved and adapted to the EarthCARE instruments by means of airborne RALI campaigns. Cloud properties retrieval method, DARDAR-CLOUD, was modified too. Variability of DARDAR-CLOUD retrieval to different microphysical models used was studied as well and radiometric measurements assimilation in the variational scheme.","Two techniques are used to verify if real-time tasks meet their deadlines : schedulability tests that return a binary result (schedulable or not) and the calculation of the response times (Response Time Analysis - RTA) which determines the length of the longest interval between the release instant and the completion of a task. Both approaches have a pseudo-polynomial time complexity and please note that no polynomial time algorithm is known. In this context, they are not particularly suitable for interactive design of real-time systems or to analyze distributed systems using an holistic analysis. In such scenarios, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm is slow, since the computations of the task response times are performed many times. Moreover, for some real time systems, such as the control-command systems, it is necessary to know the task worst-case response times and not only the binary decision on the tasks schedulability. In this context, it may be acceptable to use a faster algorithm which provides an approximate analysis instead of the analysis based on exact calculations. As these approximations will produce pessimism in the decision process, it is desirable to quantify this pessimism in such a way as to define a compromise between computation time and resource requirement of processor. That is the reason why, in this work, we propose efficient algorithms to compute upper bounds of worst-case response times and we present results on their qualities in the worst-case (competitive analysis resource augmentation) and in the average (simulations).","Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) allow sharing different kinds of data between vehicles in a collaborative way. In this thesis, we are particularly interested in road safety applications, designed for the exchange of information on road traffic and conditions. This kind of applications have strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, as data must be routed thoroughly and without any delays so for assuring the timely delivery of useful information to the drivers. In this context, data routing must face several issues raised by the high mobility and dispersion of vehicles, inadequate or completely lacking infrastructure, a variable network density, network saturation due to the large of information to deliver, and the size of the geographical areas to cover. Indeed, the problem of data dissemination in VANETs is non-trivial, and several research challenges must be solved in order to provide an efficient, collaborative, and reliable support for road safety applications. Specifically, we will address the problem of collaborative data dissemination through the following three questions: \u201cHow to perform data dissemination?\u201d, \u201cWhen should we do it?\u201d, and \u201cWhat must be disseminated?\u201d We have provided answers to these questions through the three contributions of this thesis. Our first contribution is an efficient dissemination strategy, specifically tailored to the importance of the exchanged information as well as its lifespan, which is able to avoid the intensive dissemination process that generates network congestion and data redundancy. We confirm our statements and validate the performance of our solution by modeling it using a discrete-time Markov chain, which demonstrates the number of necessary retransmissions for all concerned vehicles to receive information. Moreover, we performed extensive simulations that show a reduction of up to 90% of redundant messages with respect to message flooding dissemination strategies. Next, in order to further improve the road safety message dissemination process, we propose a communications channel access scheduler, which aims at reducing the number of collisions caused by IEEE 802.11p\u002f1609.4 multi-channel synchronizations, and thus improving the data reception rate. We base our solution on the optimal stopping theory, which chooses the right moment to send information by balancing the channel occupancy rate, the data delivery efficiency, and the maximum deferment delay tolerated by the information. To this end, we formulate the optimal stopping theory through a Markov decision process (MDP). We show through simulation-based evaluations an improvement of the reception rate of up to 25% and a reduction of up to 47% of message losses. Finally, after being interested in the quantitative aspect of network performance, we centered our efforts on improving the reliability of the dissemination process, which is obtained by motivating vehicles to cooperate and evicting malicious vehicles from the process. To this end, we propose a trust model inspired on signaling games, which are a type of dynamic Bayesian games. Through the use of our model, equilibrium is achieved, thus resulting in a fast and low-cost vehicle self-selection process. We define the parameters of our trust model through a discrete-time Markov chain model. To the best of our knowledge, our solution is the only existing solution that tackles the negative effects introduced by the presence of both malicious and selfish vehicles in a VANET. We evaluated the performance of our solution by modeling it using a Markov chain, and a set of simulations. Our results show that up to 100% of malicious vehicles are evicted while keeping a high cooperation rate, thus achieving an improvement of 42% when compared to other similar solutions","The Internet and its users are daily the object of attacks of malware. Among them, we can find the worms, which distinguish themselves from the other attacks by their automatic way of propagation. This makes them potentially very dangerous. To make their propagation easier and faster, the worms can attack popular applications. The generalization of the use of Peer-to-Peer networks makes them a perfect target of worms called \"Peer-to-Peer worms\". These worms, and in particular the passive ones, are characterized by their stealthy. Indeed, they generate no suspect traffic, and are so difficult to detect in the network. The purpose of this thesis is to propose an effective solution against the passive Peer-to-Peer worms, to make Peer-to-Peer networks, which begin to be used to distribute some legal contents such as the VoD (Video on Demand) ones, more secure. We propose several algorithms and an architecture to detect the passive Peer-to-Peer worms in the network. We evaluate our algorithms in a simulator which we have developed, as well as with an analytical study. We then study the mitigation issue of the detected worms.","The mammalian cerebral cortex is subdivided into several tangential domains calledfunctional areas, deputed to the elaboration of motor and sensory inputs and implementation of motor plans. Each functional area is constituted by six layers of projection neurons with different morphologies, connectivity and molecular codes.Several transcription factors specifying different subclasses of neurons have been identified so far. Fezf2 and Ctip2 promote the specification of subcerebralPNs, whereas Satb2 promotes callosal identity, mainly by repressing Ctip2transcription through the recruitment of the NURD complex to the Ctip2 locus.However, little is known about the mechanisms specifying their features in a timeandareal-Specific manner. In this study I show that a population of cells co-Expressing molecular markers of CPN and SCPN neurons, Satb2 and Ctip2, becomes first specified in layers V and VI of rostro-Medial mouse neocortex at perinatal stages and progressively increases between P0 and P21 in somatosensory areas. I found that in neocortices lacking COUP-TFI, a transcription factor involved in arealization, the number of Satb2\u002fCtip2 co-Expressing cells increases abnormally in layer V of the prospective somatosensory area. I demonstrated that LMO4 ectopic and premature expression of LMO4 in COUP-TFI mutant transgenic line derepresses Ctip2 in Satb2 positive cells by disturbing the assembly of the NURD complex at Ctip2 locus. Moreover, by the use of a transgenic line expressing GFP in layer V neurons and of vital dyes, I analysed morphology, connectivity and electrophysiological activity of this hybrid class of neurons.development. Toget","In a world characterized by stochasticity, volatility and ambiguity, efficiently adapting to the environment uncertainty is absolutely crucial. Such adaptation takes place over a continuum of timescales; from the tens of milliseconds necessary for neurons to modulate firing rates, to the weeks allowing structural brain changes, to the millennia needed for the complex reorganization of the brain anatomy and function like the one observed in primate evolution. In this thesis, we tackle brain adaptations to uncertain and changing environments at two different timescales. First, we investigate the fast and short-term brain functional modulations allowing adaptive decision-making behaviour in response to sudden changes in the environment. In a two-armed bandit task comprising various levels of volatility, we show that a simple inference model assuming stable external contingencies but with computation imprecisions following the psychophysical Weber law, hereafter inference noise model, performs virtually as well as the optimal Bayesian adaptive process inferring the volatility of the environment. We also establish that this inference noise model better accounts for human behavioural performance in changing environments than the optimal Bayesian one. Using model-based fMRI analyses, we show that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activations, previously associated with the volatility inferred from the optimal Bayesian model, rather reflect inference noise. Our results suggest that humans ability to adapt in a changing environment partly stem from Weber-structured inferential noise rather than from complex probabilistic inference of the environment volatility. In the second part of this work, we study how slow and long-lasting brain structural adaptations, also known as brain plasticity, go along with adaptive behaviour in new and uncertain environments at a scale of weeks. To investigate this issue, brain structural MRIs were obtained for a 44-year-old male subject, who left his regular life environment for four one-month expeditions in extremely challenging and harsh environmental conditions. Physical challenges stemmed from trekking in extreme temperatures and degrees of humidity. In addition, the subject faced great emotional and social challenges resulting from social deprivation, as he spent these expeditions in complete social isolation. Comparison of structural images before and after expeditions using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed significant changes of gray matter (GM) density in well-known regions involved in motor functions, perception, higher cognition and social cognition networks. This longitudinal case study findings show that brain structural adaptations go beyond the well-known and characterized plasticity associated with learning, by revealing brain changes in response to environmental demands, rather than task demands. This suggests that brain plasticity can happen when the environment over- or under-solicits specific functions, beyond the repetition of specific tasks. These findings are based on a single subject data, and future research should investigate whether this structural plasticity generalises to the population.","Pointwise state and shape constraints in control theory and nonparametric estimation are difficult to handle as they often involve convex optimization problem with an infinite number of inequality constraints. Satisfaction of these constraints is critical in many applications, such as path-planning or joint quantile regression. Reproducing kernels are propitious for pointwise evaluations. However representer theorems, which ensure the numerical applicability of kernels, cannot be applied for an infinite number of evaluations. Through constructive algebraic and geometric arguments, we prove that an infinite number of affine real-valued constraints over derivatives of the model can be tightened into a finite number of second-order cone constraints when looking for functions in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show that state-constrained Linear-Quadratic (LQ) optimal control is a shape-constrained regression over the Hilbert space of linearly-controlled trajectories defined by an explicit LQ kernel related to the Riccati matrix. The efficiency of the developed approach is illustrated on various examples from both linear control theory and nonparametric estimation. Finally, we provide some results for general differential inclusions in minimal time problems and identification of the graph of the set-valued map. Most of all we bring to light a novel connection between reproducing kernels and optimal control theory, identifying the Hilbertian kernel of linearly controlled trajectories.","Because of ROHS or WEEE directives, in a close future, lead materials will be banned from electronicindustry. Unfortunately, Schlumberger is using high-lead content solders for surface mount devices forhigh temperature applications. Considering this issue, Schlumberger puts in place high amount of investments to replace these solders by lead-free solders. The topic of the work is to study lead free candidates destined to support Schlumberger high temperature mission profiles. The device under test chosen for this project is a surface mount device composed of a passive component connected to a ceramic substrate by solder joints. The predictive study of reliability of these new assemblies for high temperature applications needs two complementary analyses. The first study is to characterize, experimentally, the life time of surface mount assemblies using these new lead free solders submitted to accelerated thermomechanical and isothermal aging tests. Hence, the first benefits for Schlumberger are knowledge on thecompatibility of these new alloys with their current finishes with the microstructure and intermetallic compounds evolution. More over, the main effects due to aging are investigated like failure sites and mechanisms. The second goal of the project is to perform thermo-mechanical simulations of surface mount assembly under thermal cycling. Simulations help to understand local phenomena and estimatefatigue parameters under other thermal conditions. Then, a correlation between experimental results about failure and calculated fatigue leads to an estimation of the life time of the assemblies. Thus, simulations have the advantage to reduce the number of time-consuming and expensive thermo-mechanical agingtests. To perform a simulation, the physical parameters of each solder material are needed like elastic,plastic and creep data. Additional benefits for Schlumberger involve mechanical properties which are, at the moment, unknown for these new high temperature lead free materials.","Mutations are the ultimate source of variation that allow living organisms to adapt through natural selection.  Understanding the dynamics of mutation accumulation and how they are biased stands as a keystone to understand evolutionary processes. In this work, I explored these two aspects of mutation accumulation in an evolutionary framework.First, I studied the dynamics of mutation rates over evolutionary time. As mutations may be beneficial, neutral or deleterious, the dynamics of mutation rates will be a function of two opposite driving forces: evolvability or the ability to evolve and genome stability. The resulting dynamics has been widely studied theoretically but experimental studies are scarce and mostly limited to short periods of time.Second, I focused on mutational biases. Previous studies showed that mutation rates might vary within given genomes, as a function for example of both their localization and neighboring nucleotides.All studies from this Ph.D thesis were performed in the context of the long-term evolution experiment which has been started in 1988 by Richard Lenski (Michigan State University, USA). Twelve populations were initiated from a common ancestor strain of Escherichia coli and have been propagated ever since for more than 25 years by daily transfers in fresh medium. Samples were collected and genomes of evolved clones were sequenced at regular time point intervals, allowing both the phenotypic and genomic studies of the mutation rate for more than 50,000 generations.In this study, I showed that mutation rates are highly dynamic: the emergence of hypermutator genotypes is followed by multiple compensation events. I also observed large mutational biases, including the impact of the neighboring nucleotides on resulting aminoacid changes.","Computers are ubiquitous.We trust them for a huge and increasing number of tasks, some critical.Consequences of software defects are various, from little annoyances to the loss of multiple lives.Hence, ensuring software reliability is instrumental.Fixing bugs is a very time-consuming activity of the software development cycle.In this thesis, we present interactive runtime verification (i-RV), which combines runtime verification and interactive debugging.Runtime verification is a formal method to study the behavior of a system at runtime.It consists in matching runtime traces of a system at runtime against behavioral properties.These properties are part of the system specification.Interactive debugging consists in studying a system at runtime in order to understand its bugs and fix them, inspecting its internal state interactively.Interactive runtime verification aims to make interactive debugging less tedious and more systematic by leveraging the rigorous and automated aspects of runtime verification.We aim to ease the debugging part of the software development cycle.We define an efficient and convenient way to check behavioral properties automatically on a program using an interactive debugger.We gather bug detection and bug understanding in an integrated workflow, by guiding interactive debugging using runtime verification.We provide a formal model for interactively runtime verified programs.We model the execution of a program under a debugger composed with a monitor (for verdict emission) and a scenario (for steering the debugging session).We provide guarantees on the soundness of the verdicts issued by the monitor by exhibiting a weak simulation (relation) between the initial program and the interactively runtime verified program.Moreover, we provide an algorithmic view of this model suitable for producing implementations.We then introduce a distributed and adaptive framework for interactive runtime verification.It allows checking several requirements simultaneously and debugging a distributed system composed of communicating processes.The monitors, the scenario and the debugged programs themselves run distributed using an orchestrating protocol which we verified using the SPIN model checker.Our distributed framework is designed to adapt to existing components.We present Verde, an implementation of interactive runtime verification.A first version is based on the GNU Debugger (GDB) to interactively runtime verify C and C++ programs.A second version, Dist-Verde, is an implementation of our distributed framework compatible with C and C++ programs through GDB and Java programs through JDB, the Java Debugger.We report on experiments using Verde assessing the usefulness of interactive runtime verification and the performance of our implementation.Our results show that interactive runtime verification is applicable in a variety of cases and helps to study bugs.","The Nanobacterie company is developing a simple to use, inexpensive and effective thermal treatment based on bacterial magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (magnetosomes) to treat prostate tumors. These magnetosomes, when injected directly into a solid tumor and then placed in an alternating magnetic field, provide moderate localized hyperthermia that can eradicate the tumor. Proof of concept has already been demonstrated on animals, in the case of breast cancer and glioblastoma (brain). However, the transposition of the magnetic field coil to the human scale encounters difficulties and must therefore be replaced by an alternative excitation source that is easier to use. Different excitation sources are described in the literature but, for reasons of practicality and cost, this work focuses on the use of 2 excitation sources already routinely used in hospitals. The first excitation source selected is inspired by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) which is the use of low frequency ultrasound (US). The optimal condition of use was sought by varying different parameters such as transducer size, frequency, ultrasound emission intensity, magnetosome concentration, magnetosome coating. For this purpose, magnetosomes coated with carboxymethyl-dextran (M-CMD) or citric acid (M-AC) were injected directly into a PC3-Red-Fluc prostate tumor previously implanted in athymic Nude mice; then 6 to 10 sessions of ultrasound application were performed at a rate of 3 sessions of 10 min per week. In the optimal condition group, the primary tumor disappeared completely in all mice without tumor regrowth until the end of their lives (350 days, pvalue \u003c0.0001). In contrast, without magnetosomes and with the same parameters the temperature reached is the same, but after a transient disappearance of the primary tumor (median at 90 days, pvalue \u003c0.0001), regrowth occurs. The second excitation source evaluated is the laser (inspired by photodynamic therapy (PDT)). With this device, the optimal condition obtained,  only half of the group of treated mice sees the tumor disappear until the end of its life (300 days). However, a clear hyperthermia occurs with laser-irradiated M-CMD but not without magnetosomes, demonstrating again the real involvement of magnetosomes in the temperature elevation and thus the antitumor activity. Nevertheless, the overall efficacy with laser is less good than with ultrasound. This pre-clinical protocol using ultrasound source appears to be promising for treating prostate adenocarcinoma in human clinical trials.","This thesis studies mesoscopic models adapted to the simulation of shock and detonation waves in fluids. These phenomena require systems sufficiently large to observe the complex processes occurring in this context. The aim is thus to increase the accessible time and length scales of microscopic methods, accurate but expensive, while preserving their essential properties. To this end, the multiscale coupling of methods at different resolutions allows to finely describe a specific region, limiting the computational cost. In particular, we study Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) which couples a particle discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations and thermal fluctuations that scale consistently with the resolution. The SDPD equations are reformulated in terms of internal energies, which increases the structural similarity with Dissipative Particle Dynamics with Energy conservation (DPDE). We adapt numerical schemes for DPDE to the context of SDPD in order to ensure energy conservation and stability. We study the statistical properties of SDPD and determine estimators for temperature and pressure. The size consistency in SDPD is established for equilibrium and shock waves, which leads us to propose a multiscale coupling of SDPD at different resolutions. Finally, its physical relevance is illustrated by simulating micro-jetting and detonation waves","The domain of sensors instrumentation is constantly evolving. The present work proposes the design of the key elements conception which constitute the instrumentations chains of current sensors through 3 concrete applications. The first application is speed and position measurement, for example in a wheel bearing. We present the design and realization of an analogical circuit for the conditioning of magneto resistive sensor. This sensor measures the magnetic field generated by the coding wheel magnetic poles inside the bearing. The circuit is noise and power consumption optimized on a bandwidth of few kHz. To compensate sensors variability, the circuit includes offset regulations and gains. It also contains an OTP (One Time Programmable) memory which backs up the associated sensor regulations. The second application is the measurement of EcoG's signals to interface with the human brain. We describe the design and realization of SAR ADC. It is composed of a capacitive DAC with an attenuation capacitor to reduce the total number of condensers and, in doing so, to reduce power consumption. The comparator is composed by a rail-to-rail input and multistage preamplification and output offset storage. ADC total power consumption is 86\u00b5W for 24Ks\u002fS speed and 12bits resolution. Finally the third application is the pressure measurement on aircraft wings. We describe the architectural study sigma-delta incremental ADC which reaches high resolution for low band pass signals. Its resolution is 16bits ENOB for a maximal input frequency of 100Hz and an output speed of 1Ks\u002fS. The incremental mode leads to obtain output code in answer to asynchronous requests. Each system element (converter plus sensors) has been matlab modelled. The converter digital filtering study and its digital implementation optimization are presented. This complete architectural study concludes with the sizing of each element in order to answer the technical specifications of the application.","Behavioural interactions between heterospecifics, when two previously isolated populations come into contact, generate new selective pressure on traits involved in those interactions. Particularly, the traits involved in reproductive and competitive interactions evolve due to this selection, and these adaptations can affect the speciation process. Communication plays an important role in the regulation of behavioral interactions, both between and within species. Evolution of species recognition allows behavioral adjustment to the species of the encountered individuals. The empirical studies presented here aimed to test, on a model organism (two house mice subspecies), the role of sexual selection against hybrids, and of male-male interference competition, in the evolution of reproductive isolation. Our results show that sexual selection can act in th hybrid zone between Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus, by reducing hybrid fitness, and by impeding gene flow through the zone. Interference competition however do not seem to be an important driver of the divergence of species-specific signals in the contact zone, and reinforcing selection is probably at the origin of this character displacement. Our results also enlighten asymmetries in homogamous preferences intensity, which could be due to differences in selective pressures depending on sex an subspecies. This dissertation ends on a discussion on interactions between process at play at secondary contact, and on the notion of species recognition.","A lot of studies have revealed that some organic molecules such as pharmaceutical molecules, solvents, pesticides, etc.. are frequently found in water, at concentrations below \u00b5g\u002fL, even after treatment at the exhaust of wastewater treatment plants. These molecules are highly toxic when accumulated in environment. One of the possibility for removing these micropollutants is the adsorption on activated carbons. Thus the aim of this work is to better understand the adsorption mechanism of some micropollutants onto activated carbon (ACs) in felt or fabric form.Nine micropollutants were studied, such as some pharmaceuticals: Carbamazepine (CBZ), Diclofenac (DFN), Ibuprofen (IBP), and Ofloxacin (OFX); one anti-corrosion compound : Benzotriazol (BZT); two herbicides : Mecoprop (MCP) and Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and an endocrine disruptor : Bisphenol A (BPA). Adsorption of Caffeine (CAF) which is an anthropic indicator of pollution in waste water, was also studied. The ACs (microporous KIP1200 fabric and CSV4 felt and mesoporous BBV 800 fabric, from Dacarb, France) were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 273 K, pHpzc (point of zero charge) measurements and acido-basic titrations (Boehm method). The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied at pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0C in NaHPO4\u002fKH2PO4 buffered solutions (about 0.04 M) using UV spectrometry and HPLC for the analysis of organic molecules in the remaining solution.Kinetics have been studied for 9 molecules at different initial concentrations. Time to reach adsorption equilibrium depends of the volume of the molecule and its affinity with the activated carbon. The maximum adsorbed quantity depends of the microporous volume and the specific area of the adsorbent, the adsorbed quantity is then bigger for KIP 1200 fabric than for CSV 4 felt. The speed of diffusion is slower for the adsorbent with high microporous volume, the mesoporous BBV 800 fabric gives place to a quick adsorption kinetics thanks to its large pores that gives an easy access to porosity.Binary and multi components kinetics have been done in order to understand key processes that drive kinetics adsorption. Competition between molecules have been shown (for BZT and MCP for example). Adsorption kinetics can be divided into two phases: the first one is driven by pore diffusion and the second one by thermodynamic phenomenon between the solute, the solvent and the AC.The adsorption isotherms of the molecules were studied at 13, 25 and 40\u00b0C; and the thermodynamic parameters (isoteric enthalpies and entropies Gibbs free energies) were determined. A correlation between Gibbs free energy and polarizability of molecules as well as Van der Waals energy calculated with Cosmotherm software shows the importance of non polar forces on adsorption phenomenon. Adsorption calorimetry experiments showed that entropy is the thermodynamic parameter that drives adsorption of molecules (BZT, PCP, CAF and OFX) onto KIP 1200 fabric.The pore size distributions of the carbons loaded with micropollutants were determined by DFT simulation from CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms, to investigate the porosity accessible to the adsorbate. The accessible pore are firstly the ultramicropores and then supermicropores. With this technique and thermal experiments, it has been shown that water is highly bonded inside the porosity.","The aim of this study is to determine the influence of a wall attached plane jet on the backlayering. This study is composed of two parts. The experimental part consists in identifying the behaviour of the backlayering in presence of the jet. The numerical part started with a validation of the numerical model using experimental study results. Then, a parametric study enables to determine the influence of the jet on the backlayering. The presence of the parietal plan jet induces a decrease of the backlayering length. Two main conclusions are achieved for the backlayering thickness change due to the jet : for a constant air flow velocity, the increase of the ratio between jet velocity and air flow velocity induces an increase of the backlayering thickness ; for a constant ratio between jet velocity and air flow velocity, the increase of the air flow velocity leads to an increase of the backlayering thickness. Finally, the backlayering stratification is maintained on the presence of the jet","Current therapies against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) combine one or more nucleoside analogues that directly inhibit viral replication by blocking reverse transcription step. These treatments are very effective, however, faced with the emergence of viruses resistant to these treatments. These resistances are the result of the emergence and selection of mutants with mutations can be complex in both the polymerase gene (pol) and the viral envelope. The main objectives of this PhD was to study the sensitivity of resistant HBV variants vis-\u00e0-vis similar nucleos(t)ides and new compounds non-nucleos(t)idic acting against the nucleocapsid, but also compare the performance of different viral mutants to understand the process of selection of mutants that occurs in patients under therapeutic pressure. These studies have characterized the sensitivity of some resistance mutations to nucleoside analogues, to highlight the importance of the envelope changes due to resistance mutations in the process of emergence and selection of variants in the quasispecies virus and to identify new effective antiviral drugs may allow, in combination with nucleoside analogues, to greatly reduce the phenomenon of HBV resistance. Better understanding the phenomenon of resistance, the processes of emergence, selection and transmission of HBV mutants to develop the best clinical strategies of combination therapy can significantly reduce the number of people affected by this virus","The sporadic form of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) concerns 90% of the patients and its major risk factor is the \u03b54 allele. Cognitive deficits, i. E. , spatial disorientation, have been related to the early atrophy of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Other, clinical and histological studies show the role of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones (BFCNs) in the evolution of cognitive disorders in AD. Traissard and coll. (2007) showed that the combined lesion of the EC and the BFCNs, but not each lesion separately, induces spatial memory deficits which resembles those observed at an advanced stage of AD. My work focused on damaging one or both of these two structures playing a key role in AD in young C57BL\u002f6J non transgenic males and old double transgenic hAPP\u002fhApoE females and evaluates their cognitive and non cognitive deficits. The results show that the combined EC and BFCN lesion affect dramatically spatial memory performances in navigation tasks in C57BL\u002f6J mice, whereas each lesion alone induces only moderate deficits. In addition, the BFCN lesion alone is sufficient to induce massive deficits of object recognition in mice. The profound deleterious effect of the combined lesion of the EC and the BFCN is reproduced in the hAPP\u002fhApoE3 mice. However, the BFCN alone is sufficient to induce the massive deficits in spatial learning and memory performances in hAPP\u002fhApoE4 mice. More generally, the results of this last study suggest that the presence of ApoE4 increases the sensitivity of the mice to brain damages. Our model of combined lesion appears as an interesting tool to study the neurobiological basis of cognitive deficit evolution in AD.","The main objective of this thesis was to explore the association between genetic variants potentially involved in inter-individual variability of opioids\u2019 response and side effects in the treatment of pain and opiate substitution treatment. Initially, we investigated whether genetic factors influence the response to morphine in the treatment of acute pain. The T allele of the polymorphism ABCB1 c.3435C\u003eT was significantly associated with doses of morphine and the outcome of nausea in a pilot study in Lebanese postoperative patients. Next, we examined the response to morphine in patients with morbid obesity (BMI\u003e40); in these patients, the frequency of the 118G OPRM1 allele  and the pain threshold appeared to be higher than in patients with normal BMI. The search for factors influencing the variability in response to methadone in patients treated for drug substitution showed that two polymorphisms (DRD2\u002fANKK1 TaqIA and OPRM1 c.118A\u003eG) were significantly associated with the maximum doses of methadone. In addition, three factors were associated with the CYP3A phenotype, involved in the metabolism of methadone: the use of benzodiazepines, HIV infection and a polymorphism in POR gene, which encodes an oxidoreductase. Finally, the exploration of the cardiac side effects of methadone has highlighted three factors significantly correlated with QT prolongation: methadone doses, HIV infection and the polymorphism p.Lys897Thr in KCNH2 encoding a cardiac potassium ion channel. This work demonstrates the importance of integrating both clinical and genetic data in the personalized prescription of opioids.","The ordinary nuclear matte density epsilon0 is around de 0,17 GeV\u002ffm^3 . For a critical value between 5 and 10 epsilon0 or a temperature around 150 to 200 MeV, the lattice Quantum ChromoDynamics (lQCD) predicts a phase transition from the classical matter to a new state of matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). In this state, quarks and gluons behave like free particles. Heavy ions collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are used to recreate the condition needed for a QGP formation. ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is one of the LHC experiment dedicated to the study the QGP. One of the possible signature is the suppression of the quarkonia (J\u002fpsi, Upsilon) by color screening. The ALICE muon spectrometer allows to measure the quarkonia, in a pseudo-rapidity domain -4 \u003c eta \u003c -2.5, using their decay into muons.The first part of the report presents the acceptance and efficiency corrections. These corrections are crucial for the analysis. This study has shown that the correction process is independent from the selected distribution used for the correction.The second part describes the analysis of the J\u002fpsi in proton+proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV.","Development of a reliable, real-time, selective, sensitive and suitable technique for atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy is a critical challenge in science and engineering, for sanitary, ecological and industrial issues. Tunable single-frequency lasers in the 2\u00b5m to 3.3\u00b5m wavelength range, working in continuous regime at room temperature, can be used in absorption spectroscopy to identify and quantify several atmospheric gases. We report here on the design, the technological development and the performances of 1st and 2nd order index-coupled distributed-feedback (DFB) antimonide-lasers diodes in the 2\u00b5m to 3.3\u00b5m wavelength range. The first part of this document establishes the context of the thesis, introduces the DFB theory and our modelisation. The second part presents the technological fabrication of the two different components: the side wall corrugated DFB lasers and the buried DFB lasers. The third part shows the performances of the components and the first tests on gas measurement.This work has led to the development of two different kinds of single-frequency laser diodes with high optical power and spectral purity. The fabricated prototypes will soon be used on gas spectroscopy set-up.","The development of transportation all over the world has been providing a lot of benefits for many aspects of human life. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are advanced applications that aim to make the transport networks safer, more convenient and smarter. According to their usages, they can be classified into two types of ITS applications, which are safety applications and non-safety applications. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a key component of ITS since it enables communications among transportation units. These communications support different ITS applications with various properties. Between two types of applications, we are interested in safety applications which have tighter quality and security constraints. Depending on an applied scenario of a given safety application, the exchanged information among vehicles must be broadcast locally within one-hop communication and\u002for also be notified to vehicles in large range. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the performance of safety applications in term of the quality of service and security, in both one-hop communication and multi-hop communication. We focus on reliability, connectivity and Denial of Services (DoS) attack. We study and propose technical solutions coming from lower layers (Physical, MAC and network layers) which play a fundamental role in mitigation to challenges created by the nature of the vehicular environment. Firstly, we introduce a reliable scheme to achieve the reliability for broadcasting. In our scheme, the safety messages are rebroadcast when the sender is solicited. This increases the percentage of vehicles receiving the messages while duplicated messages are limited. Secondly, with consideration of the fragmentation of the network, we study solutions that overcome the temporary disconnection in the network to bring the safety information to the recipients. Based on the social properties of vehicular networks, we propose a social-based forwarding protocol to support the communication between vehicles to points of interest that provide safety services with looser time constraints, such as search and rescue. Thirdly, we investigate jamming attack, a kind of DoS attacks, which is crucial for safety applications because of the adequate condition of the attack at the lower layers. We model jamming attack on broadcasting in order to study the degradation caused by the attack on network performance. The degradation at a certain level in network performance is an indication of a jamming attack presence in the network; therefore results from this analysis will allow us to determine network performance thresholds to distinguish between normal and attacked scenarios. However, according to our analysis, the method using the degradation as an indication to detect a jamming attack is not feasible for real-time applications. Hence, we propose methods to detect jamming attacks in real-time. Our methods allow real-time detection with high accuracy, not only at the central monitor but also at each vehicle. Therefore, vehicles are noticed about the attack soon enough to recover the communication and react to these attacks.","The security requirement should be taken into account at all stages of the software developmentlife cycle. One of the most important approaches for doing this is threat modelling. This approach involves the collaboration of several actors, in particular software architects and security experts, during  brainstorming  sessions.  Actually,  even  though  architects  are  familiar  with  the  design artifacts they handle, and they have good expertise in assembly practices, they are not always well-trained in security. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to involve these security experts at every stage of the development life cycle due to several constrains such as availability, time or budget limitations. Even when this collaboration is possible, due to the lack of guides and the absence  of  a  sufficiently  formalized  processes,  these  actors  often  have  difficulties  when interacting. Therefore, brainstorming sessions are often not carried out in an optimal manner and require  significant  efforts.  The  outcome  is  also  highly  dependent  on  the  level  of  security awareness and expertise of all the involved actors.In  order  to  improve  threat  modeling  approaches,  and  more  generally  the  considerations  of security concerns at the architectural design stage, we propose to define in this thesis a security assistance based on the concept of \u003c\u003c assets \u003e\u003e. This assistance is dedicated to architects and helps  them  to  design  secure  systems  even  if  they  have  only  limited  security  knowledge.  The process enables the identification of both relevant and vulnerable assets, which facilitates threat enumeration during the brainstorming sessions.","Randomized controlled trial is considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment, whether a drug, medical device or a strategy supported. On the contrary, observational studies would examine only the association between exposure and become a subject without being able to establish a causal link between exposure and the future. Methods of data analysis have been proposed in order to estimate the causal effect of exposure based on observational data, from these propensity scores are a method commonly used in the medical literature. In the first part of this work, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of observational studies to estimate the effect of treatment. We will present in the second part an overview of the use of propensity scores, especially in the literature of anesthesiology and intensive care. In the third part, we present a study on the performance of propensity score methods for estimating the effect of treatment in the context of survival data. In the fourth section, we report the results of a study focusing on the best way to take into account the cluster effect in the application of propensity score methods in multicentre data. This work resulted from numerical simulations and two real examples show that the optimal way to take into account a possible cluster effect , when matching on the propensity score , one would estimate the propensity score for the entire cohort and perform matching within each center. Finally, throughout this thesis, different applications work involving propensity score methods were conducted. A summary of this work is given at the end of this manuscript.","Organotypic models as human skin explants are the most complex and among the most representative of in vivo skin existing today to test the efficacy or the safety of molecules of therapeutic interest during preclinical studies. However, the loss of vascularization and lymphatic system in these models remains a major limitation in tissue homeostasis that impedes the prediction of  skin responses to a treatment. In addition,  exchanges  of nutrients and oxygen being limited to diffusion, models lifetime is limited. Different strategies have been implemented to study and improve mass transport mechanism in such models. Microfluidics offers a  great potential to control diffusion and convection mechanisms  that permit molecular exchanges in skin models.The objective of this project is to develop, characterize and validate an ex vivo perfused human skin model. The purpose of this intra-tissue infusion is to promote the exchanges of nutrients, oxygen or drugs, but also to improve metabolic waste elimination.The first objective of my work consisted in implementing an intra-tissue flow in a human skin explant, and in setting up a process to maintain the perfused model in culture for several days. To this end, a porous device was implanted in the dermis of the ex vivo human skin model NativeSkin, developed by the company Genoskin. The implantable device is then connected to a microfluidic system allowing the infusion of compounds within the tissue.The second objective was to develop analysis methods of the diffusion of compounds in skin explants. Four methods have been developed: macroscopic and qualitative evaluation of the diffusion using a dye, the study of the diffusion in real time by X-ray radiography, the study of the diffusion in three dimensions by X-ray tomography, and finally the analysis of the diffusion of fluorescent dextrans of different molecular weights, on histological sections. A numerical model allowing to simulate the diffusion in the skin model has also been developed using COMSOL software, allowing to predict the diffusion profile of a compound.The third and last objective of my work was to determine perfusion parameters allowing efficient molecular exchanges of compounds in the skin explant, but without damaging the tissue. A first series of experiments (8 donors) was carried out on models perfused with a constant flow-rate (2.5 \u00b5L\u002fmin) with culture medium, for 10 days. The results showed that at the end of the culture, skin models did not show any alteration in cell viability or tissue integrity, with maintenance of cell proliferation and metabolism. However, diffusion characterization in the model demonstrated a lack of reproducibility in the experiments, with significant inter and intra-donor variability. In addition, the infusion of different molecular weights dextrans has demonstrated that the mass transport of high molecular weight compounds was limited through the implantable device. We demonstrated that the control of the fluid pressure is critical and that imposing a pulsatile injection with slight overpressures improves the efficiency and reproducibility of the molecular species delivery and collection in the explant.These results have shown the potential of the developed FlowSkin model as a new tool to study the efficacy or toxicity of intravenously administered drugs directly onto human skin. In addition, the combination of FlowSkin with perfusion of oxygen carriers offers unique opportunities to extend the lifetime and further improve the relevance of such ex vivo skin model.","Similarity measuring is the essential quoin of the majority of data mining techniques and tasks in which information elements can take any type (quantities, qualitative, binary, ordinal, etc. ) and may be affected with various forms of imperfection (uncertainty, imprecision, ambiguity, etc. ). Additionally, the points of view of the experts and data owners must sometimes be considered and integrated even if presented in ambiguous or imprecise manners. Nonetheless, all the existing methods and approaches have partially handled some aspects of the aforementioned points disregarding the others. In reality, the heterogeneity, the imperfection, and the personalization have been separately conducted in prior works, using some constraints and assumptions that can overburden the procedure, limit their applications, and increase its computing time which is a crucial issue in data mining. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach essentially based on possibility theory to deal with all the aforementioned aspects within a unified general integrated framework. In order to get deeper insight and understanding of the information elements, the possibilistic modeling has been materialized via spatial, graphical and structural representations and applied to several data mining tasks using a medical database.","This thesis focuses on variables selection on linear models and additif functional linear model. More precisely we propose three variables selection methods. The first  one is concerned with the selection continuous variables of multidimentional linear model. The comparative study based on prediction loss shows that our method is beter to method of An et al. (2013) Secondly, we propose a new selection method of mixed variables (mixing of discretes and continuous variables). This method is based on generalization in the mixed framwork of NKIET (2012) method, more precisely, is based on a generalization of linear canonical invariance criterion to the framework of discrimination with mixed variables. A comparative study based on the rate of good classification show that our method is equivalente to the method of MAHAT et al. (2007) in the case of two groups. In the third method, we propose an approach of variables selection on an additive functional linear model. A simulations study shows from Hausdorff distance an illustration of our approach.","High-throughput, cell-based assays require small sample volumes to reduce assay costs and to allow for rapid sample manipulation. However, further miniaturisation of conventional microtiter plate technology is problematic due to evaporation and capillary action. To overcome these limitations, we developed droplet-based microfluidic platforms in which cells are grown in aqueous microcompartments separated by an inert perfluorocarbon carrier oil. Furthermore, this system allowed for an automated analysis of individual compartments subsequent to an incubation period as required for high-throughput, cell-based assays. In addition, we focused on the development of functional assays for screening antibody activity, e. G. Neutralisation of HIV or the inhibition of ACE-1. Common high throughput approaches for antibody screening use phage display or hybridoma cells. Phage display is powerful but based on binding properties rather than neutralising effects. Hybridoma cells allow for direct screening of neutralising activity, but are very restricted in the number of clones that can be screened due to their generation and proliferation as required for conventional screens. The aim of this study was the development of novel screening technology with the ultimate goal of screening single antibody-releasing cells (hybridoma cells). This system should also allow for direct B-cell screening. Once established, this technology could be used for the screening\u002f selection of many more therapeutic antibodies.","The research and the questions approached on this thesis are inverse type : the reconstruction of point-wise source or the data completion problem in parabolic models of transport of contaminants. The mathematical modelling of the problems of water pollution includes two tracers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) and the biochemical demand in oxygen (BDO) which is the quantity of oxygen necessary for the biodegradation of organic matter. Indeed, during the biodegradation process, aerobic bacteria play a leading part. These micro-organisms decompose polluting organic matters by using the dissolved oxygen in the middle. To compensate these missing data, fields, solutions of the problem, are observed directly or indirectly. The resulting inverse problems are ill-posed. Their mathematical study rises big complications and their numerical treatment isn't easy. We demonstrated a uniqueness result for fixed sources in the case of moved observations. The reality for the observation is qualified and the ideal is not acquired; direct measures on the BOD are difficult to obtain. On the Other hand to collect data on the DO is possible in real time With a moderate cost. The BOD is thus observed in indirect way, thanks to the coupling in the system of Streeter and Phelps, the information passes from the DO to the BOD. For this problem, we produced a uniqueness result for the reconstruction of source. Then, we examined the degree of instability of the equation to be solved. The behaviour of numerical methods depend on this type of information.","French vertical-flow constructed wetlands (VFCW) directly treating raw wastewater are known to perform well on for SS, COD and nitrification. They are also known to robustly cope with hydraulic overloads during rainfall events. Although numerous systems have been installed in areas equipped with a combined sewer, the limits of stormwater acceptance remain ill-defined and need to be improved. Looking at the various VFCW designs and usages reported in the literature, it is difficult to draw any consensus on their hydraulic limits. Consequently, designing VFCW to accept hydraulic overloads is a complex task, as local context strongly impacts inlet flows produced during rainfall events. Dynamic models appear a requisite for filter design in such cases. Numerical CW models have essentially focused on horizontal flow, with few attempting to study VFCW dynamics which are more commonly tackled via mechanistic models. Although mechanistic models are powerful tools for describing processes within the VFCW, they are generally too complicated to be readily used by designers. The choice between detailed description and easy handling will depend on the modelling aims. If the aim is a global design tool, simplified models offer a good alternative. However, the simplified models geared to studying VFCW dynamics are extremely reduced. They are easy-handling for design and well-adapted to specific purposes (combined sewer overflow -CSO- treatment) but not necessarily to VFCW treating combined sewer wastewater, where long-term infiltration rates vary significantly. Consequently, this PhD thesis work focused on developing a simplified hydraulic model of VFCW to guide designers through the process of adapting VFCW systems to treat domestic wastewater in both dry and rain events. The simplified model makes it possible to link (i) hydraulics, by simulation of ponding time variations, (ii) biological performances, by establishing \u201cdysfunction alerts\u201d based on treatment performance assessment and variations in online N forms effluent from the young VFCW. These \u201cdysfunction alerts\u201d plot the maximal hydraulic load that a filter can accept without compromising its biological activity. The simplified model was used to model long-term hydraulics in the VFCW (i) to analyze the impact of local context and filter design on hydraulic overload acceptance (using \u201cdysfunction alerts\u201d and bypass discharges) and (ii) to propose VFCW designs for accepting hydraulic overload in different contexts. The modelling demonstrates that VFCW can limit days with bypass discharges to less than 20 times per year without jeopardizing filter performances. Moreover, the most problematic scenario on stormwater treatment remains a watershed with high imperviousness coefficient and low slope under a Bretagne-type climate, demonstrating that the filter is more sensitive to periodicity and duration than to intensity of rainfall events.","Private homes are increasingly fitted with PhotoVoltaics (PV) for increasing the renewable energy use. Typical issues of this type of installation are : (1) the production of green energy is not necessary in line with the inhabitants' energy consumption (2) a peak of energy demand on smart grid increases the carbon emission. Mitigating carbon emission in using efficiently PV is the main objective of this research, which is part of the INTERREG NW Europe RED WOLF project (H2020 programme). This project is led led by Leeds Beckett University and involves 21 partners across Europe, including University of Lorraine. The RED WOLF project aims at installing PV solar panels and home batteries across UK, France, Netherlands, and Ireland, with the overall goal to design a Smart Storage Driver (SDS) system capables at storing solar energy produced at home, and using it when a peak of energy demand is detected on smart grid. To this end, the research is divided into three steps: (i) first, it is necessary to understand how inhabitants behave in order to obtain an energy consumption pattern for each home. This pattern will be used to size the batteries and to smartly manage the switching between the use of local and smart grid energy. Specific instrumentation will be deployed to achieve this step ; (ii) second, it is necessary to design a SDS system aiming at analysing data coming from multiple sources (e.g., smart grid, weather, indoor temperature, inhabitant behaviour, battery charge level) with one major target : the limitation of carbon emission ; (iii) finally, a global analysis ofdata management (Cloud and Fog) and network management (SDN, IoT) must be carried out in order to find the best trade off between Quality of Service offered for inhabitants and environmental impact.","The growth of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) in the fields of aeronautic, spatial and nuclear pushes the development of new material and associated processes in order to answer to the tough requirements in this business sectors. Fabrication cost savings, in particular, has helped these improvements. In this aim, the LTCS has contributed to develop an original and alternative device for the synthesis of CMC\u2019s interphases and matrices : the \u201cfilm boiling densification\u201d.This PhD as for key objective the study of original precursors for PyC and Si-O-C fabrication using this process. This manuscript is divided into two experimental parts dedicated to : i) the fabrication of carbon coatings from alcohols and ii) the fabrication of Si-O-C coatings from silylated precursors.The diverse characterization technics coupled to the numerous experiments permitted to connect the coatings structure and\u002for the chemical composition to the experimental parameters (precursor, temperature,duration). Optimal conditions were found for the preparation of high quality PyC from alcohols.For Si-O-C system, it is show that structure and chemical composition depends on experimental conditions.","Rabies is a deadly zoonosis that can affect wild and domestic mammals as much as humans. About 70,000 human deaths are reported each year, mostly in children from developing countries. Dogs, which are the major reservoir and source of the RABV species, account for 98-99% of these deaths. Currently, fourteen species of Lyssavirus, mainly circulating in chiroptera, are officially recognized. Vaccination, combined with sanitary measures, remains the best tool for preventing and controlling the disease. To date, only serology has allowed to control the effectiveness of rabies vaccination, as the production of neutralizing antibodies is the first evidence of protective immunity. Studies based on viral seroneutralisation, including my own studies, have highlighted the influence of various factors. Some of them have led to recommend modifications of vaccine protocols. They also contributed to monitor the effectiveness of individual or group vaccination field programmes and to improve these programmes. Seroneutralisation tests are also used in the context of the epidemiological surveillance of unvaccinated animal populations. I first successfully adapted these tests to lyssaviruses of interest in France. In a second step, their implementation in chiropters in France provided information on the circulation of EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 species, (only on a serological basis for the latter). This survey also allowed to highlight, within a specific colony, a phenomenon of serological transition over time, which should deserve to be studied further. However, seroneutralisation tests are difficult to be implemented in countries where rabies is very prevalent, mainly because of limited resources. My work, which recommends the use of an ELISA test as an alternative method, contributed to questioning the dogma of the necessary use of seroneutralisation tests. This test, coupled with a blood sampling system adapted to the field, should improve the monitoring of the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns for both wildlife and domestic animals, including in enzootic countries, where the quality of the blood samples cannot be guaranteed. Humoral immune response assessment tools are very valuable tools for the control and surveillance of animal rabies all around the world. My work, complementary to those carried out by other teams, has helped to make the priority objective of international organizations possible, i.e. the eradication of canine rabies in the world by 2030. However, further works are needed to improve the available tools and to propose more adapted ones, in order to achieve all the goals of eradication, for both canine and sylvatic rabies","This work is focused on the interests of difluorophosphonates as stable and non hydrolysable at physiological pH phosphates analogues which has many biological applications. Initially, different methods of synthesis involving these units are described (ionic reactions, radical, electrophilic or nucleophilic fluorination) in order to widen the scope of available and polysubstituted difluyorpophosphates. So, we considered the synthesis of fluorinated analogues of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), MEcPP and prodrugs containing nucleoside derivatives. The synthesis of the analogue of S1P was initially envisaged by ring opening reactions of 1. 2 cyclic sulfamidates, then by multi-step synthesis using an expoxide ring opening reaction. Then, synthesis of the MEcPP analogue was investigated by formation and ring opening reaction of a highly functionalized oxetane but also by substitution of a leaving group after protection of the tertiary alcohol. As far as prodrugs are concerned, a new difluoroposphoramidate formation method was investigated, the functionalization of these compounds has been undertaken, and their stability was studied at different pH.","A widening\u002fnarrowing area (ZER) of the main channel of the middle reaches of the Loire River (France), including an asymmetrical bifurcation, are studied from hydraulic measurements, multibeam bathymetries and sediment sampling. The evolution of the ZER\u2019s morphology is influenced by the morphodynamics of bars. The forcing effects induced by channel width variations and by bars configuration determine the structure of water and sediment fluxes which affect, in turn, the bars evolution. During floods, the links between hydrodynamics, bedload transport and dunes dynamics adjust to discharges variations and cause bed erosion before the flood\u2019s peak and bed aggradation after. Due to the high sediment mobility, the low flow periods highly affect the morphological evolution of the ZER. In 2010, the total bedload transport reached 480 000 t. The bifurcation influences the flow structure only after the total submersion of the inlet step of the secondary channel. The exportation of the bed-material load toward the secondary channel becomes probably significant after the erosion of the inlet step as well as by the presence of a bar in front of this step.","The inhibitory mechanisms are involved invarious domains of cognition. These mechanisms are particularly sensitive to brain damage and aging. The objective of this work was to evaluate the functioning of inhibitory mechanisms with reference to three complementary approaches: neuropsychological, metacognitive and psychodynamic. The studies reported here concern four groups: dysexecutive patients (with bilateral, right or left lesion),patients with posterior lesion, a group of older adults and a group of young healthy subjects. The neuropsychological evaluation based on Hasher and Zacks (1988) model indicate impaired inhibitory functioning in dysexecutive patients and older adults. The performance of patients with posterior was similar to that of healthy subjects. Complementary analysis indicate that dysexecutive patients and older adults tended to learn more easily words that were tagged previously as \u00abto inhibit\".Meta-cognitive assessment indicates that dysexecutive patients and older participants were more prone to distractions and interference than the other groups. They also tended to use bad strategies to resist to interference and mental intrusions. The Psychodynamic assessment shows that dysexecutive patients and older adults tended to use preferentially immature defense mechanisms. These results and their theoretical implications are discussed in relation to the current theories of executive functioning and regulation","The LHCb experiment, at CERN, is preparing a major upgrade of its detector and a change from an hardware-based to a fully software-based trigger system. It is now facing the challenge of being able to process incoming events at a rate of 30 million events per second. To cope with this massive data input, the software must be optimized to use the processing power of the filtering farm more efficiently. This thesis focus on the first algorithm of LHCb's High Level Trigger software: the Vertex Locator (VELO) reconstruction algorithm. The VELO is the first detector encountered by particles, directly surrounding the interaction region. Its goal is to find the initial track candidate that are then followed through the other layers of the LHCb detector with a good enough resolution that they could also be used to locate the origin of the collisions. The first step of this algorithm is to prepare the data by grouping pixels of the silicon sensors into hits; this process is called connected component analysis (CCA). This thesis presents multiple new CCA algorithms for both CPU and GPU architectures. A new VELO reconstruction algorithm using SIMD is presented, that enable LHCb to process events in real time and improve the quality of the reconstruction. The SIMDWrapper library, developed for the new VELO algorithm, is now part of LHCb's software and is used in other algorithms.","The [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)] (BF4) complex is probably the most studied, in the SCO community, because it exhibits good chemical stability and reversible switching between the two high and low spin states, with large hysteresis around ambient. While the crystal structure of its polymorph I is already known, we report here that of its polymorph II. However, the ambition to use these compounds in applied devices is related to their shaping. Among these, the ceramic aspect had never been studied due to their thermodynamic fragility. Thanks to Cool-SPS, we succeed to obtain the first SCO functional molecular ceramic. An optimization of the experimental sintering parameters (temperature, pressure, power, ramps, etc.) was carried out and their influences on the structural and microstructural properties and their switching behaviors were studied. And in order to develop the phase diagram (T\u002f P), a fine follow-up of the spin transition, on the powder, with a synchrotron radiation, under high-pressure X-ray diffraction provides a fine track of the pressure-induced SCO and showed a piezo-hysteresis. This work lead us, to a detailed thermodynamic study, based on existing theoretical models (Slichter-Drickamer, Sorai-Seki), in order to better understand the effects caused by the sintering of these spin-conversion compounds.","Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and in some cases, vestibular areflexia. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity are recognised. Indeed, three clinical types can be caused by mutations in one of the 10 known genes and USH2A represents the most frequently involved gene.Approximately 10 % of the USH cases remain genetically unsolved after extensive molecular analysis of the different genes, which includes sequencing of the exons and their intronic boundaries, combined to large rearrangements screening by array CGH. These unsolved cases include patients who do not carry any mutation in any of the known USH genes and patients who carry a single USH mutation. During this thesis we focalised on the study of patients carrying a single mutation in USH2A and PCDH15 gene.First, we have analysed a cohort of well-defined USH2A patients: five patients, for whom a single USH2A heterozygous mutation had been identified and one patient carrying a silent variant in trans to a nonsense mutation. For the 5 patients, we supposed that the second mutation remaining to be found could be localised deep in the introns. Indeed, a deep intronic mutation resulting in the inclusion of a pseudoexon (PE 40) in USH2A transcripts had been identified, following RNA analysis from nasal cells. Unfortunately, analysing USH2A transcripts still represent a challenging approach in a diagnostic settings and it is not always possible. To circumvent this issue, we have developed a DNA-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach to identify deep intronic variants in USH2A and evaluate their consequences on splicing. As a proof of concept and to validate this approach, including the bioinformatics pipeline and the assessment of splicing predictor tools, the patient carrying the PE 40 was analysed at first. Then, the 5 patients were studied using the defined pipeline, which led to the identification of 3 distinct novel deep intronic variants in 4 of them. All were predicted to affect splicing and resulted in the insertion of PEs, as shown by minigene assays. Through this study, we present a new and attractive strategy to identify deep intronic mutations, when RNA analyses are not possible. In addition, the bioinformatics pipeline developed is independent of the gene size, implying the possible application of this approach to any disease-linked gene. Moreover, an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO) tested in vitro for its ability to restore the splicing alterations caused by one of the identified mutation provided high inhibition rates. These results are indicative of a potential application for molecular therapy.In the second case, we have performed studies on the USH2A c.1377T\u003eA silent variant to investigate its effect on splicing. Analysis of RNA from nasal cells of patients showed that this variant led to the skipping of exon 8 in USH2A transcripts. This was confirmed by minigene assay. Moreover, preliminary studies have been performed using prediction tools and minigene assays to assess the involvement of cis-acting elements in causing the aberrant splicing.In the second part of the thesis, we have analysed an USH1 patient, for whom only one mutation had been identified in the PCDH15 gene. In this case, we combined nasal epithelial cells culture with the analysis of the PCDH15 transcripts. This was performed by sequencing five overlapping RT-PCRs. Through this analysis, we were able to delimit a region within the transcript, which failed to be amplified exclusively in the allele carrying the unidentified mutation. Further analyses have been performed in the corresponding genomic region by NGS-target capture and LongRange PCR associated with Sanger sequencing. However, no evident mutation has been identified so far. Therefore, we suggest the involvement of complex molecular mechanisms that remain to be characterised.","The emergence of renewable energy leads to a development of new technologies for energy distribution across long distances. The latter will be based on High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) to avoid capacitance losses. This network is interconnected using Gas Insulated Substation (GIS), which insulation is composed of pressurized gas (SF6) and solid insulators (epoxy resin), which have to withstand HVDC. The electric field is not anymore determined by permittivity of materials, but by resistivities and charge accumulation. In the case of an insulator with an interface with gas, electrons or ions will move across electric field lines and will charge the surface of the solid insulator. The behavior of insulator's properties (gas and solid) constitutes a major challenge for the development of HVDC GIS, to understand the charge relaxation\u002faccumulation mechanisms.In this work, the characterization of solid insulator has first been investigated, based on a low-noise current measurement method. It is thus possible to measure the leakage current through samples and onto their surface, in a pressurized gas, at high electric field and for different temperatures. Those measurements permit to evidence that both volume and surface resistivities are strongly impacted by the increase of temperature and water concentration. It has also been shown that surface resistivity has a non-linear behavior with electric field. A numerical model was developed, to simulate experimental results, showing that the surface properties of the insulator can be implemented.Furthermore, the insulating properties of the gas were also investigated through different electric field geometry (coaxial and uniform), in order to estimate the contribution of current through gas on the charge accumulated on solid insulators. It has been found that a non-negligible current passes through the gas (~pA to nA). To determine the mechanisms responsible for such currents, the latter has been characterized depending on several parameters (electrode surface roughness, material nature, electric field, temperature and relative humidity). It revealed that the variations of currents are strongly impacted by the conditioning of the device and thus by the relative humidity adsorbed on electrodes and enclosure surfaces. In presence of a dry system (dry gas and device) low current were measured (~pA), which increases with temperature. On the contrary, in case of a \u201cwet\u201d system (humid gas and device) the current decreases with increasing temperature. Those results combined with the influence of the electrode roughness, strongly suggest a mechanism of charge injection at the electrode surface, enhanced by water adsorption.Finally, the results obtained for both solid and gaseous insulations are used to develop a numerical model with a shape close to the industrial application, and observe the modification of electric field distribution in presence of water concentration and temperature gradient. An estimation of current flowing through the insulator and gas is thus possible in case of uniform and gradient temperature.In conclusion, this work gives the variations of both volume and surface resistivities in an epoxy resin with temperature and electric field. It also evidences the major influence of relative humidity and temperature on charge injection mechanisms which contribute to the current measured through gas. The extensive characterization performed, enables to develop a simulation which predicts the variations of electric field distribution within an HVDC GIS.","The first traces of Life on Earth are preserved under the form of complex carbonaceous mater embedded in the minerai matrix of siliceous sedimentary rocks named cherts. To have a better understanding of the processes controlling the evolution of such carbonaceous matter trough geological times, a set of sixteen cherts was studied. Samples were selected on the basis of their age, ranging from Neocene (45 Myr) to Archean (3. 5 Gyr), but also of their geographical setting and geological backgrounds. A multi-technical and interdisciplinary approach was adopted, combining spectroscopic techniques (Raman, EPR, NMR), but also microscopies (Optical, HRTEM) or chemical analyses (elemental analysis, pyrolysis-GCMS), This PhD work highlights the weak thermal alteration of the selected Archean samples. A methodology of carbonaceous mater datation was established, allowing contamination detection, Finally, a biomarker, i. E. A marker proving the biological origin of the studied carbonaceous matter, was proposed.","The goal of this thesis is to build a predictive model for a continuous industrial unit combining simultaneously nickel ore dissolution and iron precipitation. A two steps method was used. First experiments in batch or semi-batch reactors were done in order to understand and model separately the different phenomenon that take place. Then all the equations and associated constants were used to build a model. This work allowed some advances both on the system studied and on the methods used. First thermodynamics of Na-Fe(III)-H2SO4 solutions in the 70-100\u00b0C temperature range was clarified and natrojarosite solubility constant Na0,84H0,16Fe2,90(SO4)2(OH)5,7 was deduced. Secondly parameters acting on sodium and potassium jarosite precipitation were highlighted and their growth kinetics were deduced through an original use of caracterisctics method. Then ore dissolution kinetics were found, taking into account different ores phases and their granulometry. After deducing all the necessary parameters, an original model allowing to simulate  a cascade of dissolution\u002fprecipitation reactors with recyling loop was build and validated. This conception tool, coupled with a technico-economic study allows the optimisation of such a process.","A micro-rotorcraft is the most suited aerial vehicle for rover navigation assistance on Mars. The martianatmosphere\u2019s density, being hundred times lower than on Earth, requires the micro-drone to hover at highrotational speed. Hence, flows on the blade are both compressible and at very low Reynolds number (fewthousands). It constitutes a new aerodynamic domain to be explored. The purpose of the dissertation isto understand, simulate and experimentally duplicate the aerodynamic phenomena in a view to design anefficient propulsion system. After a phase of validation of the simulation tools, the flows\u2019 unsteady behavioris studied on 2D and 3D geometries. Wall flow is highly viscous : laminar boundary layers are thick andtheir separation has a huge influence on its unsteadiness. Then, several millions of airfoil geometries areevaluated by an optimization process based on a steady 2D solver. As final result, the optimized airfoildisplays a highly cambered shape (between 5.5% and 7%) with low relative thickness (t\u002fc \u223c 2%). Leadingand trailing edges are strongly cambered, allowing proper incoming flow adaptation and late boundarylayer separation. Based on this airfoil geometry, rotor shapes are optimized by two methods. Blade elementtheory provides a quick investigation of the most aerodynamically efficient configurations. And a free wakesolver is applied for the final design of isolated rotors and coaxial dual-rotors. Optimized shapes exhibitimportant twist and solidity, evoking marine propellers. 3D Navier-Stokes simulations highlight the flow\u2019sthree-dimensional mechanisms on the blade, which are highly correlated to the rotor\u2019s solidity and twist.Rotation stabilizes the blade\u2019s boundary layer and a stable leading edge separation is observed in somecases. Blade tip twist reduction diminishes the tip vortex and the induced loss. A thrust and torquemeasurement setup is placed in a depressurized tank for the evaluation of optimized rotors in martianatmospheric conditions. Performed experiments confirm the solvers\u2019 trend and validate the design process.Therefore, chosen coaxial dual-rotors configuration provides an important size gain for a low correspondingpower loss (\u223c 15%) compared to adjacent dual-rotors. Coaxial dual-rotors are the optimal configuration fora micro-rotorcraft in low-pressure atmosphere flight conditions. Such propulsion system (with a diameterof 30 cm) could lift a 400 grams micro-rotorcraft in hover on the planet Mars.","In this thesis, we have synthesised new cyanido bridged heterometallic molecule-based magnetic materials with the tool of simple donor-acceptor coordination chemistry. The 3d metal ion (MnII\u002fIII,FeII, NiII, CuII) based molecular precursors acted as acceptor building blocks, whereas the 4d (RuIII)and 5d (ReIV) trans-cyanido type molecular precursors were used as donor moieties.Chapter I contains a theoretical approach with examples of low dimensional magnetic materials:Single Molecule and Single Chain Magnets that illustrate the role of the cyanido ligand to design such magnetic materials. Furthermore, we emphasized the 4d\u002f5d metal based cyanido precursors for their higher magnetic anisotropy over the 3d metal ions. The choice of molecular precursors, their synthesis and characterization were extensively described in chapter II. In this research work, we have obtained many heterometallic molecular complexes and also one dimensional systems. Chapter III, IV and V contain the synthesis, X-ray crystallographic and magnetic characterization of all the newly synthesized complexes. The close crystal packing of the molecules lead to an antiferromagnetic ground state for most of the complexes and this often perturbed the magnetic relaxation phenomena. As expected, we have found metamagnetic phase diagrams for most of these systems. Some of the ReIV\u002fMnIII and a ReIV\u002fFeII one dimensional compounds exhibited Single-Chain magnet like properties and thus magnetic bistability.","This manuscript reports the studies of amyloid proteins in interaction with membrane models in order to establish their structure-toxicity relationship.Membrane models (monolayer, bilayer) of different charge and lipid composition were used. We used various physico chemical methods to characterize the interaction of these amyloid proteins with membranes.We showed the importance of the electrostatic contribution in the interactions of the amyloid protein HET-s(218-289) and its mutants with model membranes.Ellipsometry showed that the toxic mutants of HET-s (218-289) (M8, WT.Y1Y2V2) strongly disturbed thelipid monolayers at the air-water interface. The structure rich in antiparallel \u03b2 sheets of auto-assembled proteins at theair-water interface and in interaction with lipid monolayers at the air-water interface has been demonstrated by the PMIRRAS spectroscopy (Polarization Modulation - Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy). We established that theair-water interface can change the aggregation properties of amyloid proteins.By using fluorescence spectroscopy, PWR spectroscopy (Plasmon Resonance-Waveguided spectroscopy) and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Attenuated Total Reflection - Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy), we found that thetoxic protein (M8) adopted a structure rich in antiparallel \u03b2 sheets greatly altered the integrity of lipid bilayers. Incontrast, the protein non-toxic (WT) organized in a structure rich in parallel \u03b2 sheets in these interactions and it did notdisturb the homogeneity of the membranes. The toxicity of the protein M8 appears to be related to its differentorganization and its ability to rearrange membranes.Our results also support the hypothesis of the toxicity of amyloid oligomers.A study on the fabrication of a microfluidic cell for the separation of different aggregation states of amyloidproteins in order to detect these assemblies and to study their interaction with liposomes by infrared spectroscopy is presented. A CaF2 microfluidic cell with channels of 8 \u03bcm of thickness was obtained and was used for the detection of atested protein.","My PhD work generally addressed how signaling pathways control differentiation and morphogenesis in the vertebrate embryo. intercellular communication is the basis of metazoan development and evolution and is often involved in human pathologies. I take advantage of the power of functional approaches in the Xenopus embryo, to try and understand how BMP, FGF, Nodal and Notch signals are intragrated in time ans space to coordinate vatious cellular decisions. First, we showed that Nodal signaling is activated before the mid blastula transition and allow mesendoderm induction through the auro regulation of the expression of its ligands Xnr5 and Xnr6 (Skirkanish et al., submitted to development). Second, I have demonstrated that in a gastrulation movements (Luxardi et al., Development, 2010). Third, I have demonstrated that a fifth Nodal ligand, Xnr4, control medio-lateral patterning of the open neural plate and neurogenesis. Froth, we showed that a microRNA family, mir449, controls differenciation of multiciliated cells through the regulation of the Notch ligand Delta-1 (Marcet et al. Nature Cell Biology, in revision). Last, I have discovered a novel function of the BMP pathway in the control of cell type specification within the epidermal mucocialiary epithelium","In this thesis, we have developed an experimental method based on the use of a continuous ultraviolet laser to process a soda-lime glass doped with either Ag+ or Au3+ ions for the growth of silver and\u002for gold nanoparticles (NP). The main advantage of method lies in the very high photosensitivity of the glass at the laser wavelength (244 nm), compared to the results of the literature. In silver-exchanged soda-lime glasses, highly concentrated silver NP of large diameter (up to 250 nm) have been obtained and their growth is fully elucidated. We have then shown that these substrates are well-suited to get efficient surface enhanced raman scattering effect with rhodamine 6G as test molecule, which was the first aim of this thesis. A third part is then dedicated to the growth of periodic nanostructures embedded with silver NP at the surface of the glass. Silver NP (of average diameter 80 nm) are aligned along lines periodically spaced by 160 nm. After experimental characterization of these periodic arrangements, we have demonstrated very good agreement between these experimental results and classical ripples theory (known as Sipe\u2019s model in the literature).This result is undoubtedly the most original result of this manuscrit. We have then shown that laser exposure at 244 nm allows the growth of gold NP in soda-lime glass beforehand doped with Au3+ ions by thermal poling. Codoping of the glass containing with both silver and gold nanoparticles has also been achieved","Passive margins are intra-plate lithospheric structures located at the transition between continental and oceanic crust. Because of their location on the border of continents, passive margins record sediment transfer, produced by erosion of continental relief far from the margins, and complex and low intensity deformations produced by intrinsic processes (eg, flexural isostasy, thermal subsidence), intra-plate deformations, and plate boundary deformation. The sedimentary accumulation in basins and the continental denudation result in local, regional, and global processes with complex coupling. Up to the present, published studies on passive margins have generally been segmented between, unstretched and transitional domains and stretched domain of passive margin. To improve our understanding of post-rift deformation and recording of passive margin, we have done a new study incorporating the margin since unstretched domain to stretched domain. We used in this study, a new 3D numerical model coupling thermal processes, the flexural isostasy and surface processes.","This thesis aims at using the mathematical modeling with advanced control tools to guide therapies for the contraction of the tumor. The aims of this thesis are the contribution to the development of the set-theoretic methods for robust control of nonlinear systems and the development of analytical tools for the analysis and control of tumor growth in presence of chemotherapy and\u002foranti-angiogenic therapy. Generically, in the context of control theory, techniques that are theoretically based on some properties of subsets of the system state space could be referred as set-theoretic methods.In the first part, we review the definitions, concepts and tools of the existing set-theoretic methods in the literature to respond effectively to the control issues of linear and nonlinear systems with hard constraints and uncertainties. In this context, we are interested in two properties of sets that are invariance and contractiveness. The problems associated with the stability of the systems may be formulated in terms of calculation of their domain of attraction. For development purposes, we recall methods from the literature for characterizing these domains of attraction for linear and nonlinear systems. An important application of these methods is the control of tumor growth in the presence of different treatments. For this application, several constraints can be imposed in order to avoid the patient intoxications during the treatments and the set-theoretic methods can consider easily these constraints. For this latter application, we propose a methodology to estimate the domains of attraction for the mathematical models chosen to simulate the tumor growth.In the second part, we propose set-theoretic methods for the characterization of the domains ofattraction for linear and nonlinear uncertain systems. At the beginning, we develop sufficient conditions for the invariance and contractiveness of an ellipsoid for saturated systems. These conditions allow implicitly determining a local Lyapunov function. We will show that the proposed approach is less conservative than those in the literature, and we give an algorithm for characterizing the invariant ellipsoids. For uncertain nonlinear systems, we develop a sufficient condition for the robust controlled invariance in the case of parametric uncertainties. A method based on this condition is developed for characterizing the domains of attraction for nonlinear systems with these uncertainties. Then we focus on the study of nonlinear systems with additive uncertainties, and we also give a method for the characterization of their domains of attraction. These methods are easily treatable using convex optimization tools.In the third part, we develop numerical tools for characterizing the domains of attraction for themodels of tumor growth in the presence of treatments, particularly chemotherapy and anti-angiogenictreatment. These domains contain all the states of the patients for whom effective treatment protocols exist. In this context, we consider that the models are uncertain and in particular the parameters that are unknown in practice. These tools are based on the methods developed in this thesis. Several useful informations for effective tumor therapy can be extracted from these domains.","Many coherent processes can be observed when electromagnetic fields are applied to multi-level systems. Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) or coherent population oscillations (CPO) are resonant phenomena resulting in the cancellation of the absorption of the system for a probe field. EIT occurs in three-level systems and involves the coherence between two optically uncoupled levels, whereas two-level systems are sufficient to produce CPO which does not involve the dynamics of the coherences.A three-level \u039b system can be isolated in a gas of metastable helium atoms at room temperature. When excited with circular polarizations, this system exhibits EIT resonances of a few tens of kHz. If this system is excited by linear polarizations and submitted to a weak magnetic field, the response of the system is given by the combination of these two phenomena, namely EIT and CPO. A narrow CPO transmission window of a few tens of kHz has then been observed.This kind of resonant phenomena is associated with very strong variations of the refractive index at the probe frequency, leading to major changes of the group velocity of a pulse propagating in the medium. Our experimental set-up allows us to observe slow light, fast light, and even negative group velocities. Insertion of such dispersive media inside an optical cavity has been suggested to increase the sensitivity of sensors such as laser gyroscopes, but their fundamental noise depends on the lifetime of photons inside the cavity. This is why the influence of highly dispersive media on the photon lifetime inside a cavity is studied experimentally and theoretically.","The object of this PhD thesis is the investigation on the radiated near-field emission in the time-domain in order to predict the EMC compliances on the low- and high-frequency electronic\u002felectrical systems. First, chapter 1 synthesizes the existing methods and techniques dedicated to the NF emission modelling and measurement in the literature, in both frequency- and time-domain. In chapter 2, a time-frequency computational methodology is proposed which allows the extraction of TD NF maps from the frequency-dependent field data for any type of complex transient excitation. Then, in chapter 3, by considering the TF calculation method introduced previously, time-domain NF extraction methods were established based on the Plane Wave Spectrum theory combined with the fundamental plane wave properties as orthogonality, wave translation property and Maxwell-Ampere relation. Also, a TD transposition of the inverse method for NF emission modelling with elementary EM dipole arrays acting as equivalent radiating sources for the EMC emission prediction is devoted in chapter 4. All proposed approaches have been validated by simulations and measurements using passive RF\u002fMicrowave circuits. As expected, very good validation results have been found for each method introduced in this PhD thesis. Moreover, in the final chapter, a fully time-domain near-field measurement technique is proposed and described in details including the calibration method. In order to verify the efficiency of the test bench, experimentations were performed with different ultra-short excitation signals having ns-time duration.","The origin of systemic inflammation observed at a subclinical level in obese patients is still unclear. Studies suggest the participation of the intestine and dietary lipids in the onset of inflammation. The aim of my thesis was to determine whether a short-term lipid supply, rich in saturated fatty acid, could compromise the intestinal barrier integrity, which could in turn increase the endotoxin passage through the intestinal mucosa, activate the immune system and trigger local or systemic inflammation. In mice, I studied the effect of a single or repeated supply of palm oil on intestinal barrier integrity, inflammatory markers and microbiota. My results showed that a single supply of palm oil is sufficient to alter intestinal epithelial barrier and to modulate in the intestine the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine. A repeated supply exacerbates these deleterious effects and modifies the abundance of intestinal bacteria. The role of palmitic acid was analyzed on a polarized monolayer of the human intestinal epithelial cell line, the Caco-2\u002fTC7 cells. The results indicated that the deleterious effects could be exert independently of microbiota and immune cell interactions and involved the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway. Altogether, my results pave the way for further studies aiming at specifying the various cellular processes in response to dietary lipids.","The aim of this thesis was to develop a capripoxvirus based recombinant vaccine against ruminant pox, Rift Valley fever (RVF) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR) considered as a vaccine model for countries affected by these infections. The first part of the work consisted in a serological survey conducted in Tunisia to detect the PPR and RVF presence. A PPR seroprevalence of 7.6% has been found and no antibodies against RVF were detected. However, the risk of infection with rift valley fever virus persists since competent vectors such as Culex pipiens and Culex theileri has been identified in the sampled areas. The development of the RVF-PPR vaccine candidate is based on the NSmGN-FVR and H-PPR gene expression - where each of the genes is inserted into the thymidine kinase and the Interleukin 8 receptor analogue genes, respectively. The vector chosen is the vaccine strain Sheeppox Kenya-1. Although the double recombinant RVF-PPR has been produced, it could not be purified. The alternative was to evaluate the protection and the immunogenicity of the single recombinant capripoxvirus NSmGN-FVR, which is a product of an intermediate step of the process of the double recombinant preparation. The protection of our vaccine candidate has been performed by two mice experiments in Mus m. musculus MBT\u002fPas, with challenge. The number of doses, the route of administration played a key role in the protection confirmed by the presence of neutralizing anti-RVF antibodies. The study of the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was conducted in goats without challenge, RVF seroconversion has been shown. Lymphoproliferation studies and lymphocytes subpopulations typing have been analysed.","Abstract The present work focuses on the study of the elastic strain \ufb01eld heterogeneities using diffraction techniques on synchrotron and neutrons facilities, with application to a duplex steel. We have shown that \ufb01rst and second order moments of Bragg peaks, under-used as far as we know, are best suited for a mechanical interpretation of the experimental data, since no additional a priori information about the shape of the distribution of the strain \ufb01eld needs to be introduced. The related uncertainties are expressed as function of the experimental setup, and give the possibility to estimate the experimental protocol needed to reach the sought resolution. A ray-tracing software was developed and used to determine the instrumental function of two laboratory \"high resolution\" diffractometers. These approaches were used during in-situ loading tests under synchrotron and neutrons beams in order to compare the effect of the experimental setup on data. As a result, we clearly showed a re\ufb01nement of the Bragg peaks during the elastic loading of duplex specimens. Using a mean \ufb01eld homogenization model, we showed that this feature comes from a coupling between the residual stress \ufb01eld resulting from the elaboration process and the heterogeneous stress \ufb01eld induced by the macroscopic loading. Finally, we show that volumetric di#raction measurements, which can be considered as \ufb01eld measurements in the orientation space, provide a large and complete database suitable for the identi\ufb01cation of micro-mechanical models.","Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer among women. At the time of diagnosis, 30 % of patients have developed a metastatic disease either with regional lymph node colonization or distant organs colonization. Metastatic breast cancers are treated by chemotherapy or targeted therapy, according to histological results of primary site. However, 20 to 45 % of metastases have a different phenotype from the primary tumor. Getting access to metastases phenotype would therefore allow treating patients more accurately, in accordance with molecular characteristics of these lesions. Because metastases are not always accessible to biopsy, the use of molecular imaging could be of great interest. Nuclear medicine is the only molecular imaging technic available in clinical practice. The objective of this thesis was to perform the phenotypic imaging of metastatic breast cancer by targeting mesothelin and VCAM-1. The first part of this work was dedicated to the preclinical evaluation of mesothelin-targeting nanobodies. Mesothelin is a GPI-anchored membran protein. While its expression is restricted to a mesothelial cells in normal conditions, mesothelin is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer. Several mesothelin-targeting therapies are currently ongoing clinical transfer. Identifying mesothelin-expressing metastases would allow to select patients who could benefit from those therapies. During this thesis, the nanobody-derived radiotracer 99mTc-A1 has been fully validated for the imaging of mesothelin expressing tumors. The second part of this work was dedicated to the nuclear imaging of VCAM-1 expressing breast cancer lesions. VCAM-1 is a membrane-associated protein involved in the metastatic spread of breast tumor cells. An imaging agent targeting at VCAM-1 could be a suitable tool to evaluate the role of VCAM-1 as a marker of tumor aggressiveness. In the present study, the nanobody 99mTc-cAbVCAM1-5 has been validated for the imaging of VCAM-1 expression in breast cancer.","Actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments compose three major cytoskeletal structures of vertebrate cells that are characterized by highly dynamic balances between assembly and de-assembly, underlying critical cellular processes such as mitosis, architecture and movement. Consequently, cytoskeleton dysfunctions have been implicated in several pathological situations including cell transformation and metastasis. Thus, cytoskeletal networks represent major targets for the development of novel anti-cancer and anti-metastatic therapies. However, drug development is currently limited by the availability of high-throughput screening systems allowing the simultaneous monitoring of actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments dynamics in living cells. In this work, we have developed a novel screening assay of cytoskeleton dynamics based on the simultaneous recording by flow cytometry of FRET signals produced by the variation of actin, tubulin and vimentin filaments dynamics in living cells. Our novel method was employed to screen a mini-library of drugs known for their ability to interfere with post-translationnal modifications of proteins. Interestingly, our approach revealed that compounds interfering with lysine acetylation have a dramatic impact on vimentin filaments assembly and microtubules polymerization. In addition, two inhibitors (WP1130 and b-AP15) of deubiquitinating enzymes showed increase of actin polymerization. This effect was attributed to poly-ubiquitnation of Destrin, an actin binding protein. In conclusion, our FRET multiplex flow cytometry assay represents a novel effective method for the future development of new anti-cancer therapies.","Dental pulp Stem cells (DPSCs) are mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from the dental pulp. DPSCs are able to self-renew and differentiate into several cell types such as odontoblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, neuroblasts and adipocytes.The immune properties of DPSCs are being studied more and more, they harbor  Toll-like receptor on the surface and have an immunomodulatory activity.However, immune properties such as those described in professional immune cells such as phagocytosis, production of antimicrobial compounds and the new concept \"Trained immunity\" could be studied.A brief review has been developed to highlight the set of immune properties of DPSCs described in the literature. Then, experimentally, we showed that DPSCs could internalize the bacterial pathogen Bartonella quintana.In addition, we have described the ability of DPSCs to develop trained immunity. It is an inflammatory memory concerning two cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1. Priming DPSCs with the bacterial ligand LPS or PGN induces an increase in the expression and production of IL-6 and PGN after a second stimulus.Overall, the study of the immune properties of DPSCs shows that DPSCs can act as immune cells.","This work is focused on the development of original low band gap metallo-polymers to generate potential candidates for solar cell devices. In order to decrease the band gap value of the metallo-polymers, the first part of this work explores the insertion of one or two charge transfer complexes (CTC) in the ligand structure, using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as acceptor and thiophene as donor in order to decrease the band gap. The second part of this work is interested in the improvement of charge carrier mobility. The development of strategies to promote chains self-organization in the material with the introduction of an organizing group on the ligand are studied in order to generate a \u03c0-type weak interactions network or hydrogen bonds. The targeted metallo-polymers are obtained using a dehydrohalogenation reaction between a dialkyne ligand and a platinium (II) complex. Electronic, optic and physic properties characterization of these original compounds confirm the interest for using them in organic solar cell devices.","Today, data storage applications rely mainly on two types of materials: chalcogenides for optical storage (e.g. Blu-Ray) and silicon for electronic storage (e.g. Flash memory). While these materials have proven to be the most efficient for widespread applications, both have limitations. Recently, with the rise of graphene, carbon allotropes have been studied both for their intrinsic properties and for applications; graphene and other carbon allotropes have very interesting electronic, thermal and mechanical properties that can make these materials more efficient than either chalcogenides or silicon for certain applications. In this thesis, we study the feasibility and potential of the usage of carbon as a data storage material.Firstly, we focus on developing optical data storage. It is found that both continuous-wave and pulsed lasers can be used to induce reversible phase changes in carbon thin films, thus opening the way toward carbon-based data storage. Along the way, several phenomena are discovered, shown and explained by using advanced characterization techniques and thermal modelling.Secondly, we focus on electronic data storage by developing graphene-based memories that are found to switch reliably between two well-separated resistance states for a large number of cycles. To assess the potential of this new technology, we characterize the switching mechanism and develop an electro-mechanical model enabling to predict the best performances attainable: these memories would potentially be much faster than Flash memories while playing the same role (non-volatile storage).","Microwave signals are essential in the field of telecommunications whether for mobile telephony, automotive radar, Wi-Fi or even satellite transmission, without this list being exhaustive. For all these ubiquitous applications in our current society, microwave signals are the carriers for the transmission of information from a system to another. Microwave signals synthesis techniques are mostly based on Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). PLL multiply a low frequency reference ranging from a dozen to a few hundred megahertz toward a few gigahertz to a few dozen gigahertz. However, there is one main drawback with this synthesis technique: synthesizing a frequency by multiplying a low frequency reference induces an unavoidable rise of the theoretical phase noise of the synthesized signal, even more if the multiplication factor is high. On the contrary, frequency synthesis by division lowers the theoretical phase noise. Yet, high frequency high spectral purity frequency references called Coupled OptoElectronic Oscillator (COEO) are being developed for a few years. They are perfect candidate to be used as reference for frequency synthesis by division, and this is within this framework that our research takes place. We use as frequency references two COEO generating high spectral purity signals at 10 and 30?GHz. The aim of our work is then to be able to generate different signals whose frequencies are below 30?GHz and as low as 1?GHz. These synthesized signals must preserve as much as possible the spectral purity of the reference while deteriorating as less as possible the theoretical benefit brought by the division. This thesis describes the conception of low residual phase noise microwave frequency dividers operating, for the most evolved ones, fractional and\u002for programmable division ratios. In a first place, we designed static frequency dividers in order to estimate the phase noise performance that we can conceivably reach with the technology we use. Several ECL dividers by 2 and by 3 are designed, fabricated and measured for a division up to 30?GHz. A CMOS divider by 10 along with a resynchronization technique allowing to cancel most of the phase noise in a cascaded divider are also presented. In a second place, we designed analog dividers, although they have proven to be less competitive than digital dividers: an Injection-Locked Frequency Divider (ILFD) and a regenerative second-harmonic frequency divider, both realising a frequency division by 3 around 30 GHz. Finally, we designed wideband fractional dividers operating at least at 30 GHz with competitive phase noise performance. Even though they are inspired by Miller's regenerative frequency dividers, we introduce here an innovative declination of fractional dividers. A first series of static fractional dividers has been designed with ratios of 1.25, 2.5 and 4.5. Ultimately, a fractional divider with a programmable decimal part has been designed and measured. This divider has an integer part of 4 and a decimal part programmed on 4 bits.","In this thesis, we study the controllability and stabilization of certain partial differential equations.We consider first the problem of control of the 3D incompressible Euler equationby an external force of finite dimension. We show that for an appropriate choice of control space, the velocity and the pressure of the fluid are exactly controllable in projections.Moreover, the velocity is approximately controllable. We also show that the system in question is not exactly controllable by a finite-dimensional external force.We also study the controllability of the 3D compressible Euler equation. The control is a finite-dimensional external force acting only on the velocity equation. We show  that the velocity and density of the fluid are simultaneously controllable. In particular, the system is approximately controllable and exactly controllable in projections.The last section of the thesis is devoted to the study of a stabilization problem for the  2D incompressible Euler system  in an  infinite strip with boundary controls. We show that for any stationary solution (c,0) of the Euler system  there is a control which is supported in a given bounded part of the boundary of the strip and stabilizes the system to  (c,0).","Clustering reveals all its interest when the data set size considerably increases, since there is the opportunity to discover tiny but possibly high value clusters, which can not be detected with moderate sample sizes. However, the clustering of such high data volumes encounters computational limitations, requiring extremely high memory and computational resources. Thus, current clustering algorithms need frugal implementations, also demanded by institutions and industries to accomplish today's eco-friendly policies. In this context, Gaussian model-based clustering, a popular clustering technique based on Gaussian mixtures, has required frugal adaptations to overcome these computational limitations and to report, even in the huge data case, the same good performance achieved in moderate size analyses. Such implementationsare essentially based on subsampling strategies, which manage to be frugal, but they are expected to heavily failed in highly imbalanced cluster case. Thus, in this work, we propose a frugal technique, based on a so-called bin-marginal data-compression, to perform Gaussian model-based clustering on huge and imbalanced data sets. After a preliminary analysis on simple univariate settings revealing the potential of our solution (here, based on univariate binned data), we extend our proposal to multivariate data sets, where bin-marginal data are employed to perform a drastic reduction of the data volume. Despite this extreme loss of information, we prove identifiability property for the diagonal mixture model and we also introduce a specific EM-like algorithm associated to a composite likelihood approach guaranteeing frugality.Numerical experiments highlight that the proposed method outperforms subsampling both in controlled simulations and in various real applications where imbalanced clusters may typically appear, such as image segmentation, hazardous asteroids recognition and fraud detection. Then, additional topics regarding model choice, the problem of local maxima and the impact of our data-compression on clustering are dealt with a pure experimental point of view.  Finally, through a collaboration with a company specialized in predictive maintainance, a practical application of anomaly detection on real time series is shown, in order to extend the potential application domains of the proposal.","Phenylpropanoids (PPs) are one of the largest families of plants secondary metabolites. They protect plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. Nowadays, extensive research has been dedicated to PPs aiming their use as natural alternatives to synthetic antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents in food and pharmaceutical formulations. However, PPs suffer from a low water solubility, high volatility, high light and thermal sensitivity that limit their further use. This current study aimed to encapsulate seven PPs in host cage molecules, cyclodextrins (CDs), in order to develop natural and biocompatible formulation that may find applications in food and pharmaceutical fields. It focused on three main research axes. The first part dealt with the preparation and the characterization of CD\u002fPP inclusion complexes both in solution and in solid state. Characterizations were performed with Static-Headspace-Gas Chromatography (SH-GC), UV-Visible, \u00b9H NMR, (2D) ROESY NMR, FTIR, DSC and molecular modeling. These investigations were complemented with phase solubility studies. The second part was devoted to the evaluation of the effect of CDs on the PPs photostability and controlled release. The last part aimed to evaluate the CD\u002fPP inclusion complexes as radical scavengers, antibacterial and antifungal agents. Results showed that CDs could successfully encapsulate PPs, reduce their volatility, enhance their solubility and photostability and generate controlled release system. In addition, encapsulation maintained the antioxydant, antibacterial and antifungal properties of PPs. Thus, the CD\u002fPP inclusion complexes could be considered as a promising tool for formulation optimization.","As a non-invasive technology for studying brain imaging, functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) has been employed to understand the brain underlying mechanisms of food intake. Using liquid stimuli to fake food intake adds difficulties which are not present in fMRI studies with visual stimuli. This PhD thesis aims to propose a robust method to analyse food stimulated fMRI data. To correct the data from swallowing movements, we have proposed to censure the data uniquely from the measured signal. We have also improved the normalization step of data between subjects to reduce signal loss.The main contribution of this thesis is the implementation of Ward's algorithm without data reduction. Thus, clustering the whole brain in several hours is now feasible. Because Euclidean distance computation is the main part of Ward algorithm, we have developed a cache-aware algorithm to compute the distance between each pair of voxels. Then, we have parallelized this algorithm for three architectures: shared-memory architecture, distributed memory architecture and NVIDIA GPGPU. Once Ward's algorithm has been applied, it is possible to explore multi-scale clustering of data. Several criteria are considered in order to evaluate the quality of clusters. For a given number of clusters, we have proposed to compute connectivity maps between clusters or to compute Pearson correlation coefficient to identify brain regions activated by the stimulation.","Nowadays there is a growing demand for the development of fast and robust fatigue life prediction methods in the very high cycle fatigue domain. In this way, ultrasonic fatigue technique which appeared in 1950 is very interesting for manufacturers. Because the typical frequency of these tests is 20 kHz, this technique is efficient to perform tests up to a very high number of cycles in a reasonable time (109 cycles are reached in 14 h). However, the frequency domain of these fatigue tests facilities raises the issue of the effect of frequency and more generally the validity of the obtained results for estimating fatigue life of structures loaded at frequencies three or four order of magnitude below ultrasonic frequencies. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of the loading frequency on the precursors of fatigue damage, namely the microplasticity at the grain scale. This thesis work deals with the case of polycrystalline pure copper loaded in fully reversed tensioncompression. To show the effect of frequency, the W\u00f6hler or S-N curves were constructed at different frequencies. Then, the study focused on the mechanisms of microplasticity preceding crack initiation and several criteria were investigated: the morphologies of the slip bands and their locations in the microstructure, the thresholds of appearance of the slip bands, the evolution of the slip bands amount with the number of cycles, the distribution of the microplasticity in the grains, the dissipated energy during a fatigue cycle. Cross slip and vacancies production and diffusion are two mechanisms which play a part in the formation of slip bands and extrusions in surface. Their respective roles on the effects of frequency observed are discussed","The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a structurally and functionally conserved transmembrane protein from C. elegans to humans. It has mainly been known and studied for its implication in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) because one of its proteolytic products, the A\u03b2 oligomers, aggregates and forms senile plaques observed in the brain of AD patients. We investigated the physiological function of APP in the adult brain using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which harbors a single APP homologue called APP Like (APPL). The general introduction of this thesis summarizes all previous findings on the implication of APP and APPL in various aspects of neuron biology, highlighting the need for further investigation on their overarching function and molecular underpinnings. We hypothesized that APP might be involved in a homeostasis mechanism maintaining neuronal health and counteracting perturbations throughout ageing. In the first chapter, we report that APPL loss of function results in the dysregulation of endolysosomal function in both neurons and glia. We observed a notable enlargement of early endosomal compartments in neurons followed by the accumulation of dead neurons in the brain during a critical period at a young age and subsequent reduction in lifespan. These defects can be rescued by reducing the levels of the early endosomal regulator Rab5, indicating a causal role of endosomal function for cell death. Finally, we show, for the first time, that the secreted extracellular domain of APPL interacts with glia, regulates their endosomal morphology and this is necessary and sufficient for the clearance of neuronal debris in an axotomy model. We propose that the APP proteins represent a novel family of neuro-glial signaling proteins required for adult brain homeostasis. The second chapter describes a collaborative project, where we performed the RNAi screening of potential Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) candidate genes. We identified two autosomal recessive mutations found on PD families that cause a locomotion defect in fruit flies and, in the future, we will investigate further their implication in dopaminergic neurons.","Soft X-ray sources based on high harmonic generation are up to now unique tools to probe dynamics in matter on femto- to attosecond timescales. High harmonic generation is a process in which an intense femtosecond laser pulse is frequency upconverted to the UV and soft X-ray region through a highly nonlinear interaction in a gas. Thanks to their excellent spatial coherence, they can be used for lensless imaging, which has already led to impressive results. To use these sources to the fullest of their potential, a number of challenges needs to be met: their brightness and maximum photon energy need to be increased and the lensless imaging techniques need to be modified to cope with the large bandwidth of these sources. For the latter, a novel approach is presented, in which broadband diffraction patterns are rendered monochromatic through a numerical treatment based solely on the spectrum and the assumption of a spatially non-dispersive sample. This approach is validated through a broadband lensless imaging experiment on a supercontinuum source in the visible, in which a binary sample was properly reconstructed through phase retrieval for a source bandwidth of 11 %. Through simulations, the numerical monochromatization method is shown to work for hard X-rays as well, with a simplified semiconductor lithography mask as sample. A potential application of lithography mask inspection on an inverse Compton scattering source is proposed, although the conclusion of the analysis is that the current source lacks brightness for the proposal to be realistic. Simulations with sufficient brightness show that the sample is well reconstructed up to 10 % spectral bandwidth at 8 keV. In an extension of these simulations, an extended lithography mask sample is reconstructed through ptychography, showing that the monochromatization method can be applied in combination with different lensless imaging techniques. Through two synchrotron experiments an experimental validation with hard X-rays was attempted, of which the resulting diffraction patterns after numerical monochromatization look promising. The phase retrieval process and data treatment however require additional efforts.An important part of the thesis is dedicated to the extension of high harmonic sources to higher photon energies and increased brightness. This exploratory work is performed towards the realization of a compact high harmonic source on a high repetition rate mid-IR OPCPA laser system, which sustains higher average power and longer wavelengths compared to ubiquitous Ti:Sapphire laser systems. High repetition rates are desirable for numerous applications involving the study of rare events. The use of mid-IR wavelengths (3.1 \u03bcm in this work) promises extension of the generated photon energies to the kilo-electronvolt level, allowing shorter pulses, covering more X-ray absorption edges and improving the attainable spatial resolution for imaging. However, high repetition rates come with low pulse energies, which constrains the generation process. The generation with longer wavelengths is challenging due to the significantly lower dipole response of the gas. To cope with these challenges a number of experimental configurations is explored theoretically and experimentally: free-focusing in a gas-jet; free-focusing in a gas cell; soliton compression and high harmonic generation combined in a photonic crystal fiber; separated soliton compression in a photonic crystal fiber and high harmonic generation in a gas cell. First results on soliton compression down to 26 fs and lower harmonics up to the seventh order are presented.Together, these results represent a step towards ultrafast lensless X-ray imaging on table-top sources and towards an extension of the capabilities of these sources.","In April 2010, the eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland) threw volcanic ash across northwest Europe for six days which led to air travel disruption. This recent crisis spotlighted the necessity to parameterise plume dynamics through emission, dispersion and fall out as to better model, track and forecast cloud motions. This eruption was labeled as a Strombolian-to-Sub-Plinian eruption type. Strombolian eruptions are coupled with a large range of volcanic event types (Lava flows, paroxysms) and eruption styles (Hawaiian, Sub-plinian) and offer a partial precursory-indicator of more dangerous eruptions. In addition, strombolian eruptions are small enough to allow observations from within few hundred meters with relative safety, for both operators and material. Since 2001, thermal cameras have been increasingly used to track, parameterise and understand dynamic volcanic events. However, analyses, modelling and post-processing of thermal data are still not fully automated. In this thesis, I focus on the different components of strombolian eruptions at the full range of remote sensing spatial scales. These range from millimeters for particles to kilometers for the entire features via satellite images. Overall, I aim to characterise volcanic emissions through thermal vision.","The association of hydrogen\u002fdeuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HDX\u002fMS) has been emerged as a powerful analytical tool for probing structural and dynamic features of proteins. In classical bottom-up approach, the deuterated protein is digested by pepsin and the proteolytic digest is analyzed by mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) the resolution, which is limited by the size of the peptides after digestion and (2) the back-exchange that can take place in solution before the analysis by mass spectrometry. Classical tandem mass spectrometry cannot be used to improve resolution since Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) experiments on deuterated peptides have been shown for intramolecular deuterium migration before backbone cleavage (\"scrambling\"). Therefore, there is a great interest in the development of alternative HDX\u002fMS approaches in order to improve back-exchange, scrambling and resolution problems. In this work, a complete optimized workflow for robust top-down HDX\u002fMS has been set up. New system has been developed for introduction of the deuterated samples in the mass spectrometer, named \"cryosource\" and electron-based activation techniques, Electron Capture\u002fTransfer Dissociation, were used. ECD and ETD have been shown recently to fragment, in proper experimental conditions, entire deuterated proteins with minimized scrambling and single residue resolution. The cryosource leads to negligible back-exchange during long periods of time and allows low flow rates. Optimization of all parameters was done using model peptides and protein. Our final goal was to use this methodology for the structural analysis of the complex aIF2.","Usually, human beings are able to quickly distinguish between different places, solely from their visual appearance. This is due to the fact that they can organize their space as composed of discrete units. These units, called ``semantic places'', are characterized by their spatial extend and their functional unity. Such a semantic category can thus be used as contextual information which fosters object detection and recognition. Recent works in semantic place recognition seek to endow the robot with similar capabilities. Contrary to classical localization and mapping works, this problem is usually addressed as a supervised learning problem. The question of semantic places recognition in robotics - the ability to recognize the semantic category of a place to which scene belongs to - is therefore a major requirement for the future of autonomous robotics. It is indeed required for an autonomous service robot to be able to recognize the environment in which it lives and to easily learn the organization of this environment in order to operate and interact successfully. To achieve that goal, different methods have been already proposed, some based on the identification of objects as a prerequisite to the recognition of the scenes, and some based on a direct description of the scene characteristics. If we make the hypothesis that objects are more easily recognized when the scene in which they appear is identified, the second approach seems more suitable. It is however strongly dependent on the nature of the image descriptors used, usually empirically derived from general considerations on image coding.Compared to these many proposals, another approach of image coding, based on a more theoretical point of view, has emerged the last few years. Energy-based models of feature extraction based on the principle of minimizing the energy of some function according to the quality of the reconstruction of the image has lead to the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) able to code an image as the superposition of a limited number of features taken from a larger alphabet. It has also been shown that this process can be repeated in a deep architecture, leading to a sparse and efficient representation of the initial data in the feature space. A complex problem of classification in the input space is thus transformed into an easier one in the feature space. This approach has been successfully applied to the identification of tiny images from the 80 millions image database of the MIT. In the present work, we demonstrate that semantic place recognition can be achieved on the basis of tiny images instead of conventional Bag-of-Word (BoW) methods and on the use of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for image coding. We show that after appropriate coding a softmax regression in the projection space is sufficient to achieve promising classification results. To our knowledge, this approach has not yet been investigated for scene recognition in autonomous robotics. We compare our methods with the state-of-the-art algorithms using a standard database of robot localization. We study the influence of system parameters and compare different conditions on the same dataset. These experiments show that our proposed model, while being very simple, leads to state-of-the-art results on a semantic place recognition task.","Molecular electronic relates to the study of electrical transport through organic systems (polymers, molecular monolayer, single molecule) trapped between two metallic electrodes. If the electrodes are made of ferromagnetic materials, one can talk about the field of molecular spintronics. The aim of this PhD was to find an original way to study novel types of molecules. The chosen technology was a combination of nanofabrication, microfluidic and electrochemistry techniques, resulting in the use of a \u201clab-on-chip\u201d system. Before proceeding to the electrical characterizations, a rigorous study of molecular binding on surfaces was necessary. Gravimetric and spectroscopic techniques were used, giving informations on molecules adsorption on gold and nickel as well as, for spectroscopy, on molecular electronic densities revealing the potentially conducting behaviour of some molecules. Current transport measurements revealed promising conductivity properties for one of the zwitterionic molecules binding to gold electrodes and nickel, resulting in significant promises for molecular spintronics properties. Some technological improvements have to be considered, in the perspective of improving the reliability of our method, and apply it systematically to other materials.","Time-interleaved converter (ti-adc) is an efficient way to increase the speed while maintaining a good accuracy. it consists of the parallelization of several channels; each one running at lower speed. The benefit of this approach is to increase the conversion bandwidth without increasing the power. however, mismatches between the channels cause errors at the digital output and degrade the linearity and the resolution of the system. Gain, offset and clock skew errors are widely treated and we have been interested on bandwidth mismatch error which appears at high frequencies. The goal of the thesis is to develop and implement background calibration techniques for bandwidth mismatch error in a high speed ti-adc (up to 500 msps) in order to achieve a 90 db of sfdr for high input frequencies (up to 385mhz) and up to 94 db at low frequencies. An analog correction solution based on randomization was proposed and a new estimation technique based on gain extraction was implemented and validated for wideband signal.","The nuclear shell structure evolves when moving away from the valley of stability and some nuclei lose the spectroscopic properties usually observed in magic nuclei. Such observations often are linked to nuclear shape coexistence and to the inversion of normal spherical and intruder deformed configurations.Conversion electron spectroscopy is a remarkable tool to study these evolutions. It not only allows to assign nuclear spins and parity of states but is also the only way to detect E0 transitions between two states of spin 0\u207a, which is a rather strong evidence of shape coexistence.In this context, I detail in this manuscript the development of a new decay station for \u03b2-delayed conversion electron spectroscopy in the ISOL hall of the ALTO facility at IJCLab. This new system enables the collection and study of a radioactive source produced by ISOL technique and is optimized to reach very short-lived nuclei. The whole device is based on a magnetic transporter to guide electrons far from the radioactive source and greatly improve its selectivity.I finally present the commissioning of the system which was made through an experimental campaign involving the production of rubidium isotopes around mass 100. These measures allowed to characterize the response of the new decay station under normal conditions of operation and the study of shape coexistence in this region.","The increasing use of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) for complex structure, especially for medical applications, requires a better understanding of the phenomena governing their behaviors and particularly the super-elasticity. The strong thermomechanical coupling resulting from the martensitic phase transformation is a key point of this behavior. The thesis is devoted to the study and modeling of this coupling. First, the martensitic phase transformation causes coupled local deformation and heat emission  that can locate onto transformation bands when structure undergoes uniaxial stress. A part of this thesis has been devoted to the development of  InfraRed Image Correlation (IRIC). This technique permits us to measure by a single analysis, from a single IR film, both kinematic and thermal fields discretized on the same finite element mesh. An application to the analysis of a tensile test on a NiTi type AMF has been made. Superelastic behavior is also discussed from a modeling point of view. A large part of this work has been devoted to the development of  multiaxial multiscale model describing the behavior of a RVE from the description of martensitic transformation at the crystal scale. The approach is inspired from multiscale models developed for modeling other multiphysic couplings especially the magneto-elastic coupling. It is based on the comparison of the free energies of each component, without any topological description. A probabilistic comparison is made, using a Boltzmann distribution, to determine the internal variables : the volume fractions. Interfaces are not taken into account. This model allows the simulation of the effect of any thermo-mechanical loading. It well gives account of the superelasticity, including the asymmetry in tension \u002f compression ...   The third part of this thesis has been devoted to the development of a  one dimensional model for structure under uniaxial tension. In a first step, a 1D thermal model and a phenomenological mechanical model, based on the Clausius Clapeyron diagram have been developed. The simulations account for the  diffuse transformation accompanying the elasticity  at the very beginning of stress-strain behavior, and localized phase transformation afterthat. The algorithm is capable of handling two-way transformation. This model emphasizes competition both transient phenomena : generation and heat dissipation by the phase transformation and heat exchange with environment. Thus, it is able to reproduce relationship linking the number of nucleated  transformation bands to the strain rate and  the thermal boundary conditions. A study has been initiated to couple this model to the singlecrystalline multiaxial RVE model detailed in the previous part. It is currently not able to model the localization phenomenon,  but the simulations show a tensile hysteresis issued from the thermal losses in the air. Indeed, even if the local multiscale model is written in a reversible way, irreversibility and the localization are primarily structural effects.   The thermomechanical coupling is at the  origin of the so specific AMF behavior (super elasticity and shape memory effect), it has been studied from various points of view: experimentally,  by establishing RVE models, by simulating 1D structures and heat exchange.  Developed tools and models have been applied to the study of Ni49, 75at% Ti,  but are easily adaptable to other AMF. The approach used for the multi-scale modeling can be extended to other couplings, such as couplings cumulating the thermo-and magneto-mechanical aspect for the study of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloys for example.","This work investigates two research questions associated with environmental flows and their mathematical modeling.The first part is devoted to the development of finite volume methods for anisotropic and heterogeneous diffusion operators arising in models of porous media flows. To ensure that the approximate solutions lie within physical bounds, we aim at maintaining a discrete analogous of the maximum principle for elliptic operators. Starting from any given cell-centered finite volume scheme, we present a general approach to devise non-linear corrections providing a discrete maximum principle while retaining some main properties of the scheme. In particular, we study the coercivity and convergence properties of the modified schemes.The second part of this work focuses on the derivation of approximate models for shallow water wave propagation over rough topographies. In the particular case of one-dimensional polygonal bottom profiles, we first propose an adaptation of the usual derivation method using complex analysis tools. We then develop a formal approach to account for more general topographies. We propose nonlocal alternatives to some classical models (namely Saint-Venant equations, Serre equations and Boussinesq system). All these alternative models only involve smoothing contributions of the bottom.","Caviomorph rodents represent one of the most successful groups of placental mammals from South America. Despite their high modern and Neogene diversity, their early evolutionary history has long remained obscure. Recent paleontological investigations in Peruvian Amazonia allowed for the discovery of 18 Eocene and Oligocene localities yielding many new fossils of caviomorphs (mainly isolated teeth). Fifty-two taxa, including 11 new genera and 17 new species, are described here. This study reveals a rich alpha-taxonomic diversity of caviomorphs in Peruvian Amazonia during the late Middle Eocene, Early Oligocene and Late Oligocene. These three periods were until now poorly documented in the low-latitudes of South America. The late Middle Eocene localities yield the earliest representatives of the group. In these localities, the low taxonomical diversity, associated with a low morphological disparity including taxa that harbor very primitive dental features, reminiscent to those observed in coeval Old World hystricognaths, suggest that a short time range of caviomorph evolutionary history had undergone in South America prior the emergence of these rodents. The most recent caviomorph assemblages show a higher disparity and yield representatives of erethizontoids, octodontoids and chinchilloids. The exhaustive analysis of the material and its comparison with specimens from other South American localities further our understanding regarding the homology and the evolution of dentary structures in caviomorphs. A cladistic assessment with a comprehensive taxonomic sampling including most families of the four superfamilies (i.e., Cavioidea, Erethizontoidea, Chinchilloidea, and Octodontoidea) was undertaken. For the first time, several stem Caviomorpha were recognized. Low latitudes of South America are thus viewed as the cradle and the first diversity hotspot of early caviomorphs. A second radiation would have occurred during the Late Eocene\u2013Early Oligocene and would correspond to the emergence of the four superfamilies. At this time, caviomorphs would disperse towards the middle and high latitudes. The geographic origin of modern superfamilies remains somewhat ambiguous, except for chinchilloids which would emerge in low-latitude regions. A third radiation would have also occurred, around the Oligocene\u2013Miocene transition, corresponding to the more recent diversification of stem Chinchilloidea, Octodontoidea, Erethizontoidea and the emergence of crown Erethizontinae, Caviidae, Octodontoidea, and probably Chinchilloidea. It is noteworthy that these three Paleogene diversification phases were contemporaneous with global climatic events and intense Andean uplift events.","The management of intracranial vascular diseases remains complex and requires a specialized multidisciplinary team. The new diagnostic approaches in biology, imaging and neuro-sonology as well as the improvement of interventional microsurgical and neuroradiological therapeutic techniques and the organization of an adapted monitoring make it possible to optimize the outcome of the patients.The first study demonstrated the benefit of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis in adult patients with Moya-Moya syndrome. The results showed an improvement in cerebral perfusion and highlighted the benefit of pre and post-operative evaluation using transcranial Doppler, scintigraphy and MRI. Moreover, a better selection of the graft for performing the anastomosis could certainly improve the long-term results.We then studied the high flow carotido-sylvian bypass in the treatment of giant or complex intracranial aneurysms in collaboration between the Antwerp and Lille university hospitals. Our study reported the potential surgical exclusion of this type of aneurysm, which is often inaccessible to endovascular treatment, and the protective role of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis against cerebral ischemia. The choice of the graft appears to be an important parameter to adapt the flow and restore optimal physiological conditions.Finally, we determined the role of bacterial infection in the pathophysiology of development and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. In contrast to the Finnish study, we did not detect bacterial presence in the wall of intracranial aneurysms in a cohort of patients operated in our institution. These findings may explain the higher incidence of aneurysmal rupture in the Finnish population.Our works demonstrates that the development of multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic strategies improves the management of patients with intracranial vascular malformation. The goal is to better understand the physiopathology and to better choose the neurovascular therapeutic indication to offer the patient an optimal therapeutic efficacy with a minimum level of procedural risk.","Positons emission tomography (PET) is nowadays the most sensitive functional imaging modality for analyzing molecular interactions in the human body. In constant evolution, this modality has recently benefited from silicon photomultisers (SiPM) to replace conventional photomultipliers (PMT), resulting in an overall performance improvement, especially in the temporal resolution used for time-of-flight (TOF) imaging. The performance of the Vereos PET (Philips) involving digital SiPMs (d-SiPM) was evaluated both on phantoms and in clinical conditions by direct comparison with the Ingenuity PET (Philips), involving PMT and comparable acquisition and reconstruction processes. Thus, compared to its analog predecessor, we demonstrated that the Vereos PET offers an improvement in 1) spatial resolution through 1:1 coupling between scintillators and d-SiPM, 2) detectability and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of small lesions due to a better TOF resolution, and 3) in the stability of performances in the upper routine counting rates, due to higher numbers of photodetectors and trigger circuits, thereby reducing dead time and pile-up effects. While the gain in CNR provided by the TOF information is particularly useful for PET examinations performed with low statistics (reduced injected activities and\u002for recording times), the stability of performance is particularly advantageous in the dynamic exams for which the recorded activities can be initially high. In addition, the Vereos PET was modeled using the GATE platform and this modeling was validated while providing values very close to those obtained experimentally for the NEMA evaluation of the Vereos PET. Finally, a reconstruction environment specific to the Vereos PET and incorporating all the necessary corrections to obtain quantitative images was developed using the CASToR software. These direct (GATE model) and inverse (CASToR reconstruction) modeling of the Vereos digital PET scanner has enabled us to confirm the influence of certain confounding factors for image quality and they could be useful in the future, especially for optimizing imaging performance and evaluating new methods of image reconstruction and correction.","The development of machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, combined with the development of new information and communication technologies, is shaking up our societies through technological advances in a variety of sectors. The building sector is not spared, so these techniques may represent an interesting opportunity in a context where greenhouse gas emissions must be drastically reduced. The objective of this work is to assess the interest of these techniques in the field of building energy, with the aim of reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort. In addition, we ensure that this evaluation is carried out with a global vision, by placing the possible advantages in front of the different needs relating to the development of these technologies. This thesis work is organized in three parts preceded by a detailed introduction intended to give the reader an overview of the various contextual elements, thus allowing the thesis work to be placed in perspective. We then give in the first part the theoretical framework needed to understand the problems encountered during the elaboration and creation of neural networks for building energy applications. Then, a bibliographical study giving the reader a broad overview of the various applications of neural networks in the field of building energy is presented. The second part is devoted to the calibration of the building model that is then used to test and evaluate a predictive controller implementing neural networks. After an explanation of the method used and a detailed presentation of the model, a complete analysis of the calibration results is carried out. We conclude this part with observations and recommendations regarding the standard calibration guidelines recommended by three international organizations. Finally, a practical application using neural networks for the predictive control of indoor temperature is presented in the third part. After a theoretical introduction concerning predictive control, we detail the method employed to train the neural networks used. The results obtained in simulation with a predictive controller are then analyzed and compared with those obtained with two reference controllers for various simulation hypothesis. The predictive controller is thus tested in several scenarios, ranging from an ideal situation to more realistic operating conditions, including two different types of heat emitters, namely radiant ceilings and underfloor heating.","U2AF65, CAPER\u03b1, PUF60 and SPF45 are splicing factors that hold similar domains called UHM that interact during the early splicing steps with ULM domains proteins, such as SF3b155. Using biochemical approaches, we highlighted the formation of macromolecular assemblies by U2AF65 and CAPER\u03b1 in contact with the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. The inhibition of the expression of the UHM splicing factors by shRNA, followed by a qPCR analysis of 65 cassette exons led us to identify an activating role of CAPER\u03b1, U2AF65 and PUF60 and a repressing role of SPF45 in splicing. Particularly, CAPER\u03b1 and U2AF65 activate splicing of cassette exons presenting long pyrimidine-rich 5' flanking regions. Moreover, these regions favor the formation of macromolecular assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPER\u03b1. On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which multivalent interactions lead to CAPER\u03b1 and U2AF65 macromolecular assemblies; these assemblies present a particular affinity on one hand for long pyrimidine-rich introns and on the other one for the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155.  All these interactions promote 3' splice sites recognition.","This thesis focuses on the wave propagation in disordered waveguides. First, we introduce the basic tools and concepts in order to present the different transport regimes and phenomena related to coherent effects (such as universal conductance fluctuations, enhanced backscattering or Anderson's localization). Beside the remarkable phenomena associated to diffuse transport, the coherent effects are also noticeable when the spatial distribution of the scatterers displays symmetries. The second part is dedicated to the observation of a significant and broadband enhancement in transmission through opaque barriers. The sensitivity of this phenomenon to symmetry defects is discussed in Chapter 4. Limitations due to absorption, which are always present in an experimental context, and localization are also inspected. The fourth chapter focuses on one of the signatures of the localization regime: the propagation within these insulating media is insensitive to the source. We present some special cases in which this property is broken. Finally, several preliminary studies related to other propagation phenomena in complex media are discussed as perspectives for this work.","In the superphosphate-based fertilizers production process, the attack of phosphate rock by sulfuric acid generates odorous gaseous by-products. Although their emissions are within regulatory limits, superphosphate fertilizer plants are likely to cause odor nuisance to residents. This thesis proposes to study the feasibility of a process of odor treatment by ozonation in homogeneous gas phase. A first step of prioritization of the chemical compounds with the most important odorous potential has been realized. This ranking was established from a technical report provided by our industrial partner based on a campaign of olfactometric measurement and chemical characterization of the gases emitted by the chimney of a superphosphate fertilizer production plant. From the calculation of the odor activity value (OAV), two families of compounds were targeted: sulfur compounds - represented by hydrogen sulphide (H2S), ethylmethyl sulphide (MES) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) - and aldehydes (represented by propanal and butanal). Two analytical techniques (GC\u002fFID and SIFT\u002fMS) were applied in order to evaluate the elimination performance of these compounds, the difficulty of analyzing a gaseous matrix containing ozone having been demonstrated. Thus, ozone interference on GC\u002fFID analysis of aldehydes has been identified. The SIFT\u002fMS technique, in turn, required significant development. The ozonation of model gaseous effluents was carried out following the elimination of the target compounds under different operating conditions (residence time, reactor temperature, ozone concentration and moisture) in an experimental field compatible with the industrial constraints. The sulfur compounds exhibited high removal rates, particularly in the case of H2S, whose conversions reached about 80%. Organic monosulfides (MES) and disulfides (DMDS) were less reactive to ozone, as conversions remained quite low (around 30% for the same level of O3\u002fsulfur ratio). In the range of operating conditions used, neither the moisture nor the residence time in the reactor showed considerable influence. The ozone concentration is the most influential process parameter, having a positive effect on the conversion rates of the three sulfur compounds studied. Meanwhile, for DMDS, an increase in reactor temperature also improved the conversion. Overall, the highest conversion rates were obtained for the highest O3\u002fsulfur ratios and reactor temperature. Conversely, even when the most favorable reaction conditions have been applied (highest temperature and ozone concentration), the aldehydes have been inert to ozone. Despite the low conversions obtained, the use of SIFT\u002fMS has identified the main by-products of the ozone-sulfur compounds gas phase reaction as methylethylsulfoxide (MESO), methylethylsulfone (MESO2), dimethyl thiosulfinate (DMSOS), isomers of dimethyl thiosulfonate (DMSO2S), dimethyldisulfoxide (DM(SO)2) and also sulfur dioxide (SO2) and trioxide (SO3). The odors treatment process by direct ozonation of the gases at the outlet of industrial chimney thus appears difficult to envisage because of the low efficiency of malodorous compounds elimination demonstrated in our tests. On the other hand, this technique coupled with chemical absorption could be interesting to eliminate the olfactory nuisances with a good efficiency","The objective of the more electrical aircraft project is the replacement certain of the hydraulic and pneumatic systems by electrical ones. This drastic technological transition will require the increase of the onboard electrical power, which will result in the increase of voltage levels of the embedded networks. Current systems of 28 VDC and 115 VAC (400 Hz) are to be replaced by +\u002f- 270 VDC and 230 VAC (360 to 1000 Hz). These new conditions of voltage levels will have a significant impact on the appearance of partial discharges that were almost absent up until present. Aeronautical grade electrical connectors being one of the major elements of embedded networks, the aim of this thesis is to study the conditions of occurrence of partial discharges in them. In this work, electrostatic modeling is carried out in order to identify the zones within the connectors where there is a strong electric field facilitating the appearance of partial discharges. Also presented are the results of experiments under both DC and AC voltage in which the ignition voltages of partial discharges and their location within the structure of the connector were studied.","As of 2017, we live in a data-driven world where data-intensive applications are bringing fundamental improvements to our lives in many different areas such as business, science, health care and security. This has boosted the growth of the data volumes (i.e., deluge of Big Data). To extract useful information from this huge amount of data, different data processing frameworks have been emerging such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark. Traditionally, these frameworks run on largescale platforms (i.e., HPC systems and clouds) to leverage their computation and storage power. Usually, these largescale platforms are used concurrently by multiple users and multiple applications with the goal of better utilization of resources. Though benefits of sharing these platforms exist, several challenges are raised when sharing these large-scale platforms, among which I\u002fO and failure management are the major ones that can impact efficient data processing.To this end, we first focus on I\u002fO related performance bottlenecks for Big Data applications on HPC systems. We start by characterizing the performance of Big Data applications on these systems. We identify I\u002fO interference and latency as the major performance bottlenecks. Next, we zoom in on I\u002fO interference problem to further understand the root causes of this phenomenon. Then, we propose an I\u002fO management scheme to mitigate the high latencies that Big Data applications may encounter on HPC systems. Moreover, we introduce interference models for Big Data and HPC applications based on the findings we obtain in our experimental study regarding the root causes of I\u002fO interference. Finally, we leverage these models to minimize the impact of interference on the performance of Big Data and HPC applications. Second, we focus on the impact of failures on the performance of Big Data applications by studying failure handling in shared MapReduce clusters. We introduce a failure-aware scheduler which enables fast failure recovery while optimizing data locality thus improving the application performance.","III-nitride nanostructures have been attracting increasing attention due to their peculiar properties and potential device applications as lighting LEDs. The control and evaluation of the doping in the nanostructures is a crucial, yet a challenging issue. This thesis advances the field by exploring the n and p type doping process of GaN nanowires (NWs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In particular, their electrical properties have been revealed through a multi-technique approach at the single NW level.Firstly, the structural and electrical properties of a series of Si-doped (n-type) GaN NWs have been studied. High resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements on single NWs have illustrated the achievement of a higher Si incorporation in NWs than in epilayers, and Si segregation at the edge of the NW with the highest doping. Furthermore, direct transport measurements (four probes measurements from 300 K down to 5 K) on single NWs have shown a controlled doping with resistivity from 10^2 to 10^-3 \u2126.cm, and a carrier concentration from 10^17 to 10^20 cm-3. Field effect transistor measurements have evidenced the n-type nature and a high electron mobility of the non-intentionally doped NWs.Secondly, the growth conditions of Mg-doped (p-type) and axial GaN p-n junction NWs have been determined to achieve significant Mg incorporation. Furthermore, the electrical properties of the axial GaN p-n junction NWs, dispersed on SiO2 and contacted by ITO, have been studied using electron beam induced current (EBIC) technique.  EBIC technique revealed the location of the p-n junction and clearly demonstrated its operation under reverse and forward polarization. Moreover, EBIC showed highly resistive p-GaN in accordance with the difficulties to perform direct transport measurements on p-GaN NWs.This original study provides a nanoscale description of the electrical and doping properties of the GaN NWs, facilitating the fabrication of the future GaN nanostructures based devices.","Continuous galvanizing process involving immersion in a molten zinc bath is commonly used to form zinc coatings on steel sheets. Before hot\u2010dip galvanizing, the steel sheets are annealed at a temperature of 800\u00b0C in a N2 atmosphere containing 5 vol.% of H2, with only traces of water. This heat treatment is used to recrystallize the steel substrate and to reduce the iron oxides in order to improve the wettability by liquid zinc. At the same time, the less\u2010noble alloying elements of the steel preferentially oxidize and diffuse towards the surface. The aim of this study is a better understanding of selective oxidation of ferritic steels. The binary alloys of FeMn are studied in this work. The oxide particles are found to be composed of manganese oxide MnO. External oxidation is found to be dependent on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. Particles of different shapes are observed on ferrite grains of different orientations: square particles are found on the (100) surface, triangle particles on the (110) surface and hexagon particles are found on the (111) surface. Further theoretical study was carried out using numerical simulation with DFT method and SIESTA code. No significant influence of manganese presence has been found on the dissociative adsorption energy of dioxygen at the atomic scale. However, the diffusion barrier of the Fe, Mn, and O atoms are much less on the (110) surface than on the (001) surface. This can be an explanation for why the particles are bigger on the (110) surface than on the (100) surface.","An important breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms governing the process of iodide transport inside thyroid cells has been the cloning in 1996 of the protein responsible for this transport : the Na\u002fI symporter (NIS). Different studies have been conducted ever since in order characterize this protein as well as the mechanisms which regulate its expression and its activity. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms of transport regulation and the proteins implied in the posttranslational regulation of the symporter remain largely unknown. The full understanding of these mechanisms would allow the treatment improvement of a lot of patients. Iodide transport is indeed involved not only in different thyroid pathologies, but also in radioactive iodide contaminations following nuclear accidents and in promising anticancer strategies by gene transfer. Chemogenomics, also called chemical genetics, is a multidisciplinary approach which goal is to explore the living systems thanks to small organic molecules. To better understand the mechanisms which govern iodide transport, our laboratory has set up a direct chemical genetic strategy which allowed us first to discover 10 molecules able to inhibit iodide transport. The objective of this thesis was to identify the protein targets of two molecules : ITB5 and ITB2. Electrophysiological and isotopic flux studies showed that these two molecules have a different mechanism of action. Their study should then allow the identification of at least two proteins involved in iodide transport.To identify the protein targets of ITB5 and ITB2, different probes were synthesized. These probes are made from the compound of interest, a photoactivable group allowing the creation, under light irradiation, of a covalent bound with the protein target(s) and a Biotin or Desthiobiotine molecule to extract the labeled proteins from cellular lysates. Once labeled and captured on agarose-Streptavidin beads, the proteins of interest were separated on SDS-PAGE gels stained either with silver nitrate or Coomassie blue. The corresponding bands were excised, digested by trypsin and the obtained peptides analyzed by mass spectrometry. A query made in the data bank Swissprot with the data obtained after the experiments conducted with the probe ITB5-P2 allowed us to identify 3 proteins apparently interacting with the compound ITB5. The experiments based on ITB2 had to be suspended because of a lack of time but encouraging results have been obtained. A band which may correspond to a protein specifically labeled by the probe ITB2-P1 has indeed been observed on a Western-blot after a first on-bead capture experiment. However, we couldn\u2019t visualize it on a gel because of the important presence of proteins captured non specifically by the beads. The capture experimental conditions were optimized with the compound ITB5. These conditions will now be applied to the compound ITB2 and this should allow us to obtain cleaner gels on which the band of interest will be excised for an analyze by mass spectrometry.","Environmental bioprocesses are gaining importance in the industrial landscape. Nevertheless, the complexity of mechanisms involved in biological reactions stays an issue for their implementation. Moreover, available measurements of biological activity are often off-tine and\u002for indirect. ln this context, phenomenological modeling tools are a solution to link observations of the system to underlying biological reactions, considering the right hypotheses. These methods require a rigorous sensitivity analysis in order to properly process the results. Thus, the models permit to obtain precise knowledge about biological systems thanks to indirect measurement. This approach was developed throughout two cases of study corresponding to two industrial fields of application. Bioremediation is the most ecological method for hydrocarbons contaminated soils remediation. Nevertheless, biodegradation can be long or absent depending on environmental conditions. In order to measure its efficiency, respiration measurement in the gas phase seems to be the easiest observation to implement. Oxygen measurement can be insufficient on its own, that is why a model able to describe the evolution of the apparent respiratory quotient has been developed considering the different steps of biodegradation. This observation alone could give insights on the efficiency of biodegradation. The second part of this work deals with activated sludge wastewater treatment using the theoretical approach developed for soil bioremediation. The eft\u00efciency ofthe process depends on the excess production of sludge, which is linked to the heterotrophic yield of the reaction. This parameter is a key component for modeling and optimization of wastewater treatment plant. Most of the time, its common definition is not sufficient to explain its observed variations. In this context, several phenomenological models derived from the activated sludge models were studied to explain these variations, taking into account the substrate storage process. An experimental study was conducted in order to confront the reactional hypothesis of the models to actual measurements of single substrate degradations in respirometer. The balance between substrate storage and direct growth was proposed as a main component of the yield value. This study resulted in a necessary clarification of the heterotrophic yield definition.","This thesis deals with sensor-based control of robots. For a robot arm or a mobile robot, this approach consists in defining robotic tasks directly in the sensor space. This scheme is known for its good properties of accuracy and stability. The robot may still have an undesired behavior when the motion to perform is large or when constraints have to be respected. Classical schemes uses supplementary degrees of freedom to perform the main task while respecting the constraints. First we propose a new framework for sensor calibration from velocity measurements. The same formulation allows to estimate both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of an exteroceptive sensor. Simulations and experiments illustrate this approach in the case of camera calibration. A generic framework is then exposed for multi-sensor-based control under several constraints. All constraints are introduced in the control law in the same way. The induced behavior is the respect of all constraints, while perturbing the main task as little as possible. Our formalism is applied to classical issues in robotics, that are joint limits avoidance and the visibility constraint in visual servoing. Numerous constraints are then combined into a single system.","Since there is not a firm without a stock of unsold goods, the study of this phenomenon is an issue of great importance. Indeed, firms face the stock of unsold goods that they want to clear at the end of the market period. The latter has an impact on not only on the firm's production process, but also on the economy growth. In this context, how to value the stock of unsold goods and when should the firm clears it ? This doctoral work aims to answer to this fundamental question from the standpoint of economics. For this purpose, we must first determineat which price a firm can clear its stock of unsold goods and then determine when it should have recourse to selling-off market or clearance sales ? The first part of this thesis is dedicated to a review of the literature, both related to management and marketing science, but also to economics. The second part focuses on an original model of unsold goods' stock valuation which is adapted to the microeconomic hedging methods used in finance (including options where the demand is uncertain). Results show that it is possible to provide a hedge against the risk of a stockof unsold goods. On the one hand, the theory is adapted to the case of supply and on the other hand, it fits the case of a stock of unsold goods. From the theoretical point of view, the results of numerical simulations illustrate the way this method works in practice for different cases. The third part is more general since it introduces two intertemporal original models under the monopolistic market structure.There are two types of consumers, depending on the degree of their sensitiveness to the display of goods (those who are sensitive versus those who are not). Consumers who are relatively strongly sensitive to the display of goods choose to buy apart from it. Furthermore, the monopoly chooses both the price and the quantityof displayed goods in order to maximize its profit. Under certain or uncertain demand,it always emerges a stock of unsold goods. The monopoly can sell the stockof unsold goods, either directly to consumers who are insensitive to the display ofgoods, or to the selling-off firm. Endogenous selling-off market is then studied.","The fatigue behavior of the polychloroprene, a synthetic rubber, relies on : Damage caused by the initiation and the propagation of the cracks The reinforcement caused by the strain-induced crystallization The self-heating of the sample The equilibrium between those three phenomena was investigated by following the evolution of the hysteresis area and the stiffness during constant amplitude fatigue tests Some pre cycling tests allowed the modification of this equilibrium by working on a sample with a loading history. The presence at the beginning of the fatigue test of cracks in the sample, which undergoes at that time of the test a very low self-heating, is subjected to a more important effect of the strain induced crystallization. The fatigue characteristic of the CR is well enhanced. Some variable amplitude tests made possible the observation of the consequences of the modification of this equilibrium. It leads to the drawing of a stiffness\u002fhysteresis diagram allowing the unification of the curves at a given solicitation, independently of the loading history. A fast method derived from the study of the evolution of the hysteresis area to find the fatigue limit at 106 cycles using the crack initiation approach has been presented.","Malaria has occurred in 80% of the counties in China in the past. After several decades of effort, malaria prevalence decreased drastically and China is currently approaching elimination throughout the country. Information on malaria vectors is still found not well documented, which could hinder the development of appropriate surveillance strategies and WHO certification. The major risk to malaria elimination is the re-introduction of the disease from imported malaria cases. There are an increasing number of imported malaria cases caused by Chinese citizens returning from malaria-affected countries recently. The information about their characters, drivers and route of introduction in different areas will provide evidence-based data to policy makers where and when to carry out the interventions. This will in turn allow them to develop efficient guidelines for risk-assessment of malaria re-introduction and for allocating appropriate resources. As a country with over 1.3 billion population and a territory covering different climatic zones, lessons learnt from malaria elimination in China that could serve as references to other countries. According to the Belt and Road initiatives, China will participate more globally to governance related activities. Partners and stakeholders within Global malaria elimination campaign are interested to the future opportunity and potential fields that would involve Chinese expertise. 1.A summary analysis was conducted on the nationwide distribution of malaria vectors, their bionomic characteristics, control measures and related studies. The distribution in China of the principal malaria vectors was found reduced, in particular for Anopheles lesteri and Anopheles dirus s.l., including the two main malaria vector species, An. dirus and An. baimaii, which nearly disappeared after several years of malaria control effort. Anopheles sinensis, which was previously reported to be less efficient in malaria transmission, is becoming the predominant species in Southwestern China. The field sampling results indicated the existence of high efficient malaria vectors, e.g. An. minimus and An. harrisoni at the China-Myanmar border. In addition, elevated human-biting rates, high adult and larval densities, and parous rates were found in both An. sinensis and An. harrisoni, which reveal a very high receptivity and risk of malaria re-introduction along the China\u2013Myanmar border. 2.The comparative analysis of imported malaria cases reported from former non-endemic areas and former endemic areas in China showed that all former non-endemic areas are now reporting imported malaria cases. 3. A summary analysis on malaria elimination progress since 2010, was carried out with specific focus on mapping the residual malaria foci and the distribution of malaria cases in China. The incidence of locally acquired malaria has declined sharply along with the concomitant decrease of malaria-endemic areas from 762 counties reporting malaria in 2010 to just two counties adjacent to border areas (Yunnan Province: China-Myanmar and Tibet, China-India) in 2016. In 2017, China achieved zero indigenous malaria case report for the first time. In conclusion, China is on the track to achieve malaria elimination by 2020. The risk of re-introduction caused by the emergence of imported malaria cases and the occurrence of highly efficient malaria vectors present in the country is still the target of malaria surveillance. To maintain malaria elimination, intensified international collaboration with specific focus on cross-border areas and mobile\u002fmigrant population is called to take actions. The pilot studies on how to introduce the lessons learned from malaria elimination in China and the Chinese expertise are on the list to take action in future, which would harmonize the China aid to malaria elimination in the target countries.","Communicating objects are inviting themselves into daily life leading to digitization of the physical world. This explosion of multimedia wireless applications for consumer electronics makes the power consumption a key metric in the design of multi-mode wireless portable devices. Conventional transceivers have fixed performances and are designed to meet high performances in all wireless link conditions. However, most of the time, the channel of communication is not at worst case and these transceivers are therefore over specified. Being aware of the channel link conditions would allow such devices to adapt themselves and to reduce significantly their power consumption. Therefore, the challenge is to propose a QoS (Quality of Service) in terms of communication range, response time as instance, equivalent to industrial modules with a reduced overall power consumption.To address this purpose, this thesis proposes a design strategy for the implementation of adaptive radio-frequency receiver (Rx) modules. Hence the Rx front end achieves the correct QoS for various scenarii of communications with a minimum of power consumption.As a proof of concept, the adaptive approach is demonstrated with the design of a tunable LNA (Low Noise Amplifier). As the first element of the receiver chain, the LNA limits the receiver in terms of sensitivity and is therefore a good candidate to perform reconfiguration. The body biasing of the FD-SOI (Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator) technology is first exploited to reduce the power consumption of a circuit and then as an opportunity to perform circuit tunability.","The first part of this thesis concerns the development of a novel type of Zeeman slower (ZS) that is based on permanent magnets and has several advantages over the conventional ZS. We present the performances of the apparatus for two different magnet configurations: the \\emph{dipole} and \\emph{Halbach} configurations. The second part is about scattering experiments of guided matter waves on a complex potential. After describing the experimental setup that produces Bose-Einstein condensates in a crossed dipole trap, we report on three experiments. The first experiment studies the scattering of a matter wave on a finite size optical lattice that forms a Bragg reflector. We discuss the processes involved in the scattering and we study in detail the transmissivity across the Bragg mirror. We then demonstrate the trapping of a propagating Bose-Einstein condensate in a Bragg cavity that originates from the envelope of the lattice. We observe oscillations inside the cavity and partial tunneling out of the cavity for narrow classes of velocity. This technique allows to characterize new types of tunnel barriers in position space equivalent to submicronic repulsive barriers. Finally, we study the scattering of matter waves on an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, and analyse the transmissivity across this structure when varying the modulation frequency. We describe the complex dynamics at play within the Floquet-Bloch framework and the use of this technique to realize a new type of tunable velocity filter. This filter does not rely on any specific internal state configuration","Membrane proteins (MPs) present on the surface of living cells are part of a central class of the cell proteome. They are involved in many biological processes such as viral infections or cellular immune response. Producing these proteins for structural or functional studies is a difficult task because of their instability once extracted from their original membrane. Currently, most processes involve the purification of these proteins in a detergent and their stabilization in artificial environments. These costly and time-consuming methods do not always allow to preserve the natural architecture of these proteins.Eukaryotic cells have the ability to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). They are made of a lipid bilayer comparable to a plasma membrane that contains MPs. They constitute true intercellular communication pathways and are currently the focus of much interest from the scientific community. In order to test the contribution of the use of EVs in the study of MPs, we have developed a process to rapidly obtain these over-expressed MPs on the surface of EVs produced from mammalian cells. This method has been first developed and validated on the glycoprotein of the Ebola virus envelope and then extended to other types of MPs such as the human CD73 enzyme. Finally, EVs have been used for the generation and selection of camelid antibodies against the Herpes virus envelope glycoprotein B.Based on all these results, EVs definitely seem to be an advantageous tool for obtaining, storing and using MPs in an environment as close as possible to their natural state.","This thesis is in the field of optimal control and is divided into two parts. The first part investigates an optimal control problem derived from modeling, which consists of maximizing the biomass production at harvesting time under a constraint on the water required for irrigation in a context of limited resources.The problem is presented as a state-constrained optimal control problem with a target, subject to a  non-autonomous dynamical system where its right member is non-smooth. First, we address the state constraint by comparing the trajectories above the highest biomass production threshold. Next, we apply the generalized principle maximum and show that an optimal solution can have one or several singular arcs only on the non-smooth points of the dynamics. Finally, we propose three different strategies of irrigation and make a numerical comparison between the 3.The second part deals with the study of the minimal time of crisis problem that minimizes the time spent by a trajectory solution of a controlled system outside a given set K. The main characteristic of this kind of problem is the discontinuity of the integrand with respect to the state at the border of the set K. We first propose a new regularization method of the minimal time crisis problem using additional control and a penalty function. We show the convergence of the sequence of optimal solutions of the new problem to an optimal solution of the original problem.We then propose a more general regularization scheme where we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to the smooth optimal control problems, and we study the boundedness and the convergence of the resulting extremals.  Under a more general hypothesis than the usual one faced in the literature, which claims that any optimal solution hits the boundary of the constraint set in a transverse way, we derive the necessary optimal condition of the minimal time of crisis.","In physiological conditions, robust immunological mechanisms avoid adverse responses to food antigens. In contrast, in celiac disease that affects about 1% of Western populations, exposure to dietary gluten of genetically predisposed HLA-DQ2.5\u002f DQ8 individuals triggers a chronic small intestinal enteropathy. Previous studies in humans have established the crucial role of HLA-DQ2\u002fDQ8 restricted gluten-specific intestinal CD4 T cell response. This CD4 T cell response is necessary but is however not sufficient to induce tissue damage. Other studies have pointed to the role of interleukin 15 (IL-15). Thus, IL-15 over-expressed in the mucosa of celiac patients can interfere with immunoregulatory mechanisms and stimulate the activation of cytotoxic CD8 T intraepithelial lymphocytes, thought to induce epithelial lesions. Whether and how gluten-specific CD4 T cells and IL-15 interact to activate CD8 T intraepithelial lymphocytes and to drive intestinal tissue damage has not been however established. To address this question, we have set up a mouse model based on the breeding of OTII mice possessing CD4 T cells specific of a model antigen, ovalbumin, with heterozygous transgenic mice overexpressing a secreted form of human IL-15 in intestinal epithelium (hIL-15Tge mice). Resulting OTII+\u002f- B6 and OTII+\u002f- hIL-15Tge+\u002f- mice were exposed to dietary ovalbumin from the prenatal period until 3 months of age. Upon chronic exposure to ovalbumin, OTII+\u002f- hIL-15Tge+ mice, contrary to their OTII+\u002f- B6 littermates, developed growth retardation, and villous atrophy associated with expansion of intestinal cytotoxic CD8 T cells, as in celiac disease. Moreover, we showed that IL-15 impaired immunoregulation by FoxP3+ T cells and cooperated with IL-2 produced by OVA-activated CD4 T cells to stimulate the expansion of non-cognate cytotoxic CD8 T cells. We suggest that a comparable scenario can operate in celiac disease. During this study, I observed that chronic overexpression of IL-15 was associated with an expansion of CD103+CD11c+CD11b- mononuclear cells. In the Supplementary results, I have shown that this effect depends on the production of GM-CSF secreted by IL-15-activated NK cells and that CD11c+ DCs differentiated in mice overexpressing IL-15 were enriched in CD103+ cells and displayed enhanced cross-presentation abilities in vitro. The latter results illustrate how IL-15, by orchestrating a crosstalk between NK cells and mononuclear phagocytes, can modulate adaptive immune responses.","This work has focused on 2 major issues encountered after angioplasty and stenting of arterial occlusive disease: intra-stent restenosis and thrombosis.To prevent these postoperative complications, drug eluting stents (DES) have been developed and are currently available for clinical use; they elute antiproliferative drugs overtime which limit smooth muscle cells migration and proliferation. Long-term results of DES are jeopardized by a high late in-stent thrombosis rate (RR 1.2 vs bare metal stent) which is correlated to a higher late death rate (RR 1.32 vs bare metal stent) [Lagerqvist Bo et al., N Eng J Med 2007]. We present an original process of immobilization of a specific anchor on a metallic substrate which has the ability to directly immobilize drugs onto the metallic surface. It can also indirectly using specific biocompatible polymers load drugs onto the metallic surface which would be eluted overtime. The target for both systems is the cellular response involved in the restenosis and thrombosis process.This specific anchor, which is dedicated to several substrates, is developed from marine mussels gel [Waite JH et al., Science 1981]. It is currently a common basis for covalent immobilization of drugs and\u002for polymer systems able to sustain drug release.The first part of the project involved the development of a specific chemical anchor through an immobilization surface strategy. This dopamine anchor includes an activated ester, which is the starting point of the creation of a polymer with defined and controlled chain length. The generated polymer of N-(Acryloyloxy)succinimide has the ability to absorb a controlled and defined amount of drug; it has been linked with glucosamine to illustrate the potential of the system - glucosamine is a proteoglycan from the extracellular matrix of the arterial wall. The system has then been characterized and optimized for every parameters; unfortunately, results were not as good as expected regarding SMC proliferation.The Dopamine anchor has thus been modified to allow interactions with more chemical functions, including amino- and carboxylic functions. Finally, we used it under alkaline conditions (pH=8.5) where dopamine generated a network of polydopamine [Lee et al., Science 2007].Afterwards, we report an original functionalization of metallic surfaces with a hydrophilic, biocompatible and biodegradable cyclodextrin based polymer. This polymer acts as a reservoir for hydrophobic drugs allowing the sustained release of anti-proliferative drugs and promotes natural arterial wall healing. The polymer of CD is well-known in our research department and has already been used as an active coating onto textile for vascular devices [Martel B et al., European Polymer Journal 1995]. In this setting polydopamine was applied as a first coating layer onto the metallic surface in order to promote a strong anchorage of a cyclodextrin based polymer that was \u201cin situ\u201d generated from the native cyclodextrins and citric acid as a crosslinking agent through a polycondensation reaction. After optimization of the grafting process, the ability of this system to act as a drug eluting system was evaluated with paclitaxel (PTX) and simvastatine. PTX is a reference drug for current vascular drug eluting stents [Creel CJ et al., Circ Res 2000]. PTX is currently coated on vascular stents with a \u201cpolymer-free\u201d method [Dake et al., JVIR 2011]. It is a highly lipophilic antiproliferative drug, and that \u201cpolymer free\u201d system was compared as a positive control to our functionalized scaffold. We compared the results of our functionalized surface loaded of PTX and Simvastatin. Simvastatin is a pleiotropic molecule with targeted actions on arterial disease, inflammatory process and dyslipidemia [Balk EM et al., Am J Med. 2004]. [...]","Solid-state NMR with magic angle spinning (MAS) has emerged as a powerful technique for investigating structure and dynamics of insoluble or poorly soluble biomolecules. A number of approaches has been designed for reconstructing molecular structures from the accurate measurement of internuclear proximities, and for probing motions at atomic resolution over timescales spanning several orders of magnitude. Despite this impressive progress, however, MAS NMR studies are still far from routine. Complete determinations, which are often demonstrated on model microcrystalline preparations, are still rare when it comes to more complex systems such as non-crystalline amyloid fibrils or transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. My work aimed at extending the possibilities of MAS NMR for applications on complex biomolecular systems in different aggregation states. For this, I exploited the unique possibilities provided by high magnetic fields (700, 800 and 1000 MHz 1H Larmor frequency) in combination with the newest MAS probes capable of spinning rates exceeding 60 kHz. These experimental conditions al- low to boost the sensitivity of MAS NMR through 1H detection at high resolution and to enrich the palette of probes for protein dynamics. The first part of the thesis reports on my contribution to the development of new strategies for backbone resonance assignment, for structure elucidation, and for investigation of backbone and side-chain dynamics. These methodologies significantly reduce the requirements in terms of experimental time, sample quantities and isotopic labeling, and enlarge the molecular size of systems amenable to NMR analysis. The second part describes the application of 1H detected MAS NMR to evaluate the role of protein dynamics in problems such as amyloid fibril formation and membrane protein function. I first addressed the amyloid fibril formation propensity of human beta-2 microglobulin, the light chain of the major histocompatibility complex I. I performed comparative studies of backbone dynamics of the wild type protein as well as a D76N mutant in crystals, and determined some of the structural features of the fibrillar form. This allowed to identify the presence of pathological folding intermediates and to formulate hypotheses on the mechanism of fibrils formation. Finally, I studied the local and global dynamics of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. In particular, I investigated the mechanism of action of the alkane trans- porter AlkL from P. putida in lipid bilayers. The measurement of parameters for fast (ps-ns) and slow (\u03bcs-ms) backbone dynamics of the protein in presence or in absence of a substrate highlights possible routes for molecular uptake and lays the basis for a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the process.","Rhabdomyolysis is a frequent cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The toxic effect of myoglobin was thought to be the main factor involved in this disease. Since macrophages (M\u00d8) have been suspected to populate the kidney after rhabdomyolysis, we set out to investigate their role and polarization status, whereby M\u00d8 are classified as either M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (wound-healing). Diverse renal M\u00d8 phenotypes were observed in a mouse model: two days after rhabdomyolysis, R1 (F4\u002f80loCD11bhi) were dominant. By day 8, R2 (F4\u002f80hiCD11b+) became dominant. Liposomal clodronate (CL)-mediated M\u00d8 depletion indicated that the early infiltration of R1 was deleterious. Transcriptionally regulated targets, such as chemokines and extra-cellular matrix components were identified and verified to be expressed in a M\u00d8-dependent manner. Via single-cell analysis R1 and R2 were shown to express both M1 and M2 markers. Inflammatory processes seemed to be directly favoured by myoglobin since it induced in vitro tubular cells to secrete chemokines and M\u00d8 to change their polarization status. Early CL-mediated M\u00d8 depletion improved kidney repair and mouse survival. Seven months after rhabdomyolysis, the fibrotic lesions were significantly reduced in the CL-treated group, suggesting that early M\u00d8 depletion limits long-term injuries. We also performed a study to assess the interest of detecting endothelial inflammation during AKI via enhanced molecular imaging targeting VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). This non-invasive technology appears to be a relevant approach.","Cancer-related anemia is thought to be mediated by the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF[alpha]). TNF[alpha] is one of the major mediators of inflammation and has been linked to the inhibition of the erythropoietin (Epo) production from kidney, leading thus to anemia. However, the inhibitory effect of TNF[alpha] on erythroblast differentiation has been suggested by several in vitro studies. Previous results from the LBMCC lab on human leukemia cell lines showed that TNF[alpha] prevents over-expression of erythroid-specific genes in human erythroleukemia cell lines. In all cases, the inhibitory effect of TNF[alpha] was in correlation with the inhibition of the erythroid key transcription factor, GATA-1. In order to study the inhibitory effect of TNF[alpha] on the Epo-mediated erythropoiesis, we used CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as a model. In our in vitro model, we reproduced different stages of erythropoiesis, allowing us to use this model for the study of TNF[alpha] and the erythroid lineage. The study of hemoglobin production, the cell morphology and the analysis of specific erythroid membrane markers, have shown the limited capacity of Epo to stimulate HSC erythroid differentiation under TNF[alpha] treatment. At the molecular level, we have correlated this effect to the reduced expression of erythroid-specific genes. Moreover, TNF[alpha] reduces the transcriptional activity of GATA-1 and induces its interaction with PU.1 via p38MAPK activation. Furthermore, GATA-2 expression is increased and the GATA-1\u002fGATA-2 balance, which is critical for erythropoiesis, is partially disturbed by 144\u002f451 miRs inhibition from TNF[alpha]","Rare earth transition metal alloys display unusual magnetic properties, which make them interesting systems to study ultrafast magnetization dynamic and to test mechanisms underlying spin torque. Diversity of magnetic properties observed in such alloys is bound to the lack of fine knowledge about their structural properties. I developed an ultra high vacuum chamber for deposition of thin alloys layers. Using absorption (EXAFS) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), I put in evidence the amorphous structure of the alloys and the presence of a monolayer of Gd segregated at the surface. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and magnetic dichroism (XMCD), I showed the uniaxial in-plane anisotropy of the films, exhibiting a compensation wall at the ad-hoc composition. I investigated the thermal evolution of the magnetization of the Co and Gd sub lattices, accounted by simulations performed from a mean field model. Ultrathin Pt\u002fCo(5\u00c5)\u002fPt films display an easy axis for magnetization anisotropy perpendicular to layer surface. When this anisotropy and the dipolar one, which drives the magnetization towards the plane, are of the same order of magnitude, a transition from perpendicular to planar anisotropy, so called spin reorientation transition (SRT), occurs. During my PhD, I studied the mechanism underlying such reorientation of magnetization and the slow fluctuations regime associated, whereas the anisotropy is finely tuned by ion irradiation.","Aging is the cause of different dermatological diseases, facilitated by extrinsic factors, especially UV radiation: skin cancers, dermatoporosis, ulcers \u2026 Chronic ulcerations cause chronic pains, hospitalizations, increasing cost of health, death in the elderly population. Yet, the link between skin aging, microvascular aging and ulcers remains still unclear. Our objective is to study microvascular function on the gaiter skin area of elderly, because abnormal microvascular reactivity could contribute to ulcerations in this region, after development of the techniques used to assess cutaneous microvascular reactivity to young subjects. The first part of our work is interested in the most recent methods of measure of the cutaneous blood flow. It aims at comparing the Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging and the Laser Doppler Imaging in terms of reproducibility then at estimating the correlation of the measures according to these two techniques. The second part is a methodological study concerning the microdialysis, to determine wether intradermal or subdermal microdialysis fibers insertion can be used to assess post-occlusive hyperemia and local thermal hyperemia. In the third part, we study the physiological aging of in the supramedial malleolar skin, high-risk area of ulceration to the elderly subject. Further studies are required to determinate whether the changes in the physiological microvascular responses to local heating explain the higher incidence of skin ulcerations in the elderly.","This work aims at studying fundamental physical and chemical processes induced by ionizing radiation on isolated biomolecules. The first part is devoted to the development and characterization of the experimental set-up PIBALE (Plateforme d'Irradiation de Biomol\u00e9cules et d'Agr\u00e9gats Libres et Environn\u00e9s). The goal of this apparatus is to analyze ion-induced ionization and fragmentation of biologically relevant molecular systems. The biomolecules are produced by means of an electrospray ionization source, mass-over-charge selected, bunched in an ion trap and subsequently extracted to the collision zone. Fragment cations produced during the interaction with the atomic ion beam are analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multi-coincidence detection of the fragments will allow describing the fragmentation kinematics. The second part of this thesis is focused on the gas phase study of a collagen peptide, collagen being the most abundant structural protein in the human body, as well as a hydrogen-bonded collagen triple-helix model. Photo-absorption experiments, from UV to soft X-rays, show that several molecular orbitals can be probed with a single photon and that a smooth transition from excitation to ionization occurs. Above the ionization threshold, the excess energy is distributed into the internal ro-vibrational degrees of freedom and induces inter- followed by intra-molecular dissociation. Thus, photon irradiation could lead to collagen denaturation by the loss of its triple-helix structure. Moreover, collagen-specific fragmentation channels have been found to be triggered by photon absorption.","This thesis deals with the study of protonic diffusion, and to a lesser extent ionic, inside a Gd-doped BaCeO3, a possible electrolyte for fuel cell, using a multi-scale approach. First of all, first principles calculations have been made to determine stable positions for protonic defects OH_O and oxygen vacancies V O in the material. Then, using the same formalism of density functional theory, energy barriers for both kinds of defects have been computed between two stable positions. Finally, these barrier heights have been used in a Kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm to simulate trajectories of protons or oxygen vacancies. This method allows to access macroscopic values that can be found by experiments, such as activation energy, diffusion coefficient or mobility, using only atomic data coming from ab initio simulations. Gadolinium seems to be an interesting dopant in barium cerate considering its weak power of attraction on the proton: the introduction of gadolinium creates lots of oxygen vacancies that will be able to incorporate water molecules, without trapping the hydrogen. Both these conditions are necessary to get a good electrolyte for protonic ceramic fuel cell.","This thesis is made of two independent parts, both relying heavily on the theory of \u221e-categories. In the first chapter, we approach two different ways to formalize modern particle physics, through the theory of vertex algebras and the theory of factorisation algebras a la Costello. We show in particular that in the case of \u2018topological field theories\u2019, they are equivalent. More precisely, we show that the \u221e-category of non-unital factorization vector bundles on a smooth complex variety X is equivalent to the \u221e-category of non-unital finite dimensional EM-algebras where M is the topological manifold associated to X. In the second one, with Mathieu Anel, we study a characterization of exponentiable objects of the\u221e-category of\u221e-toposes.We show that an \u221e-topos is exponentiable if and only if its \u221e-category of sheaves of spaces is continuous. An important consequence is the fact that the \u221e-category of sheaves of spectra on an exponentiable \u221e-topos is a dualisable object of the \u221e-category of cocontinuous stable \u221e-categories endowed with its usual tensor product. This chapter also includes a ix construction of\u221e-coends from the theory of tensor products of cocomplete\u221e- categories, together with a description of\u221e-categories of sheaves on exponentiable \u221e-toposes in terms of Leray sheaves.","Modern storage systems have to face the surge of the amount of data to handle. At the current scale, it would be an illusion to believe that a single centralized storage device is able to store and retrieve all its users' data. While from the user's viewpoint the storage system remains a single interlocutor, its underlying architecture has become necessarily distributed. In others words, storage is no longer assigned to a centralized storage equipment, but is now distributed between multiple independent storage devices, connected via a network. Therefore, when designing networked storage systems, bandwidth should now be taken into account as a critical resource. In fact, the bandwidth of a system is intrinsically a limited resource which should be handled with care to avoid congestion. The focus of this thesis is to optimize the available bandwidth of distributed storage systems, lowering the impact of churn and failures. The objective is twofold, on the one hand the purpose is to increase the available bandwidth for data exchanges and on the other hand, to decrease the amount of bandwidth consumed by maintenance. We present three distinct contributions in this manuscript. The first contribution of this thesis presents an hybrid peer-to-peer architecture taking into account the low level topology of the network i.e., the presence of gateways between the system and the users. The second contribution proposes an adaptive and user-level timeout mechanism, based on a Bayesian approach. The third contribution describes a repair protocol especially designed for erasure-coded stored data. Finally, this thesis concludes on the possibility of employing interference alignment techniques in order to increase the efficiency of repair protocols especially designed for encoded data.","Antibiotic therapy has been effective in controlling many infectious diseases, but is slowly reaching its limits with the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. The search for alternative molecules has become a necessity. This thesis explores the possibility of using antibacterial peptides (bacteriocins) produced by bacteria as a means to fight resistant bacteria. Strains of lactic bacteria producing bacteriocins have been isolated essentially from various fermented Moroccan foods. The bacteriocins produced were purified by chromatographic techniques, and their structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry, peptide sequencing and \u002f or nucleotide sequencing. This allowed the identification of one or more bacteriocins per producing bacterium, e.g. enterocins L50A and L50B produced as modified forms by Enterococcus durans LC2 isolated from camel milk. At the same time, the search for multidrug-resistant bacteria in human body fluids has resulted in the isolation of pathogenic bacteria of both Gram types resistant to a variety of commonly used antibiotics. Among these, selected strains were subjected to the action of purified bacteriocins (enterocins L50A and L50B, nisin Z and pediocin PA-1) alone and in combination with antibiotics. This allowed us to show the efficacy of bacteriocins against multi-resistant pathogens, thereby demonstrating their potential as a possible alternative in case of antibiotic inefficiency.","The project aims to develop a new strategy to specifically treat the myocardium in heart failure with the formulation of CE3F4, an inhibitor of the EPAC1 protein. This protein is ubiquitous and is particularly involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and pathological cardiac restructuring. The CE3F4 has been identified as a candidate to inhibit EPAC1 to block the deleterious hypertrophic development seen in heart failure. Preliminary studies on CE3F4 have shown a low aqueous solubility as well as metabolic instability in rat liver microsomes. In addition, due to the ubiquity of the target in different tissues, it is necessary to control the distribution of the CE3F4 by promoting cardiac tropism. The development of nanovectors encapsulating the CE3F4 appears to be a promising approach. Indeed, these vectors can be functionalized at the surface by specific ligands of the heart, allowing the specific addressing of the encapsulated CE3F4.\tDuring this thesis, liposomes and lipid nanocapsules were formulated. These particles have significantly increased the apparent solubility of the CE3F4, and the lipid nanocapsules provided protection of the CE3F4 against the enzymatic degradation observed in vitro in the plasma of C57BL\u002f6 mice. Indeed, a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the molecule was observed in murine plasma thanks to the development of suitable analytical methods. In addition, an interspecies difference was observed in the plasma metabolism of the CE3F4, which was negligible in human plasma. A biodistribution study was carried out in C57BL\u002f6 mice with \u00b3H-CE3F4 encapsulated or not in lipid nanocapsules radiolabelled with \u00b9\u2074C. A very rapid distribution outside the blood compartment was observed in both groups, with almost instantaneous dissociation of the \u00b3H-CE3F4 from \u00b9\u2074C-nanocapsules.","Genomes rapidly evolve through rearrangements that can generate new genome organizations or lead to the acquisition of foreign coding sequences or the loss of non-essential functions. Several mechanisms of rearrangement were uncovered for Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes that involve mobile genetic elements (MGE). Species from the archaeal genera Thermococcus present numerous genomic inversions but none of the previously known inversion drivers. To better understand the genomic evolution of Thermococcales, I investigated two of their MGE families: the pTN3 and pT26-2 plasmid families. Specifically, I focused on the tyrosine recombinases (or integrase) that these plasmids encode and that catalyze their site-specific integration in the host chromosome. I demonstrated that the plasmidic integrase Int\u1d56\u1d40\u1d3a\u00b3 is responsible for chromosomal inversions in the host Thermococcus nautili through an unprecedented homologous recombination catalytic activity. I also characterized two other related Thermococcus integrases and only one catalyzes homologous recombination. The structure resolution of Int\u1d56\u1d40\u1d3a\u00b3 and primary sequence comparisons will now provide clues about the genetic determinants of site specificity and of the homologous recombination activity. The three integrases all belong to an archaeal-specific class of integrases that catalyzes a suicidal integration. The integrase gene is partitioned and presumably inactivated upon integration. The integrated MGE is then trapped into the chromosome. The evolutionary benefits of this suicide activity are puzzling. I identified 62 related suicidal hyperthermophilic integrases and reconstructed their evolutionary history. They are highly prevalent and recruited by diverse MGE. I also showed that one of these integrases can catalyze in vitro site-specific recombination at near boiling water temperature, representing an advantage in hyperthermophilic environments.","Membrane proteins are extremely rich in aromatic amino acids, like tryptophan (W). This particularity is found in many antimicrobial peptides and in several virus fusion proteins. An example of these fusion proteins is the HIV-1 envelop glycoprotein, the gp41. It is clear that the W residues are implicated in membrane perturbation and pore formation. The aim of this work was the investigation of the W residue role in such activities, using the nonlinear optic. First, we determined the W hyperpolarizabilit\u00e9 (nonlinear potential) by the Hyper Rayleigh Scattering (HRS). Then, the evolution of the nonlinear signal of small synthetic peptides, as function of the increasing number of their W residues, was demonstrated. These results allowed us to follow the W residue involvement of two peptides, K3W4 and gp41W, in the interaction with lipids monolayer at the air-water interface, using the second harmonic generation (SHG). The influence of such interaction in the peptide structure and orientation was determined using the PM-IRRAS. In conclusion, we showed the coherence between the SHG signal variation, due to the W orientation changes, and the PMIRRAS spectra modification, due to the gp41W helix orientation changes","Since the invention of the first photon counting sensors, several technological breakthroughs have been made in the field of photon counting imaging systems, notably with the invention of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD). Even though SPAD sensors became a key technology, the direct time-of-flight (D-ToF) SPAD sensor is not really interesting for the 3D imaging application due to its low spatial resolution and high noise level in outdoor operating conditions. These limitations are mainly based on the format of the raw SPAD data being in the form of time correlated single photon counts (TCSPC). Therefore, two research axes have been pursued in this thesis in order to rethink the format of the raw SPAD data. The first axis consists in developing alternative acquisition and reconstruction methods based on variational Bayesian approaches, with the aim of extracting only latent information from the statistical model of TCSPC data. While the second axis focuses on the compressive sensing (CS) domain in combination with custom regression methods or deep learning algorithms for reconstruction.","Proper packaging of eukaryotic genomic DNA into chromatin is important for proper DNA compaction and gene expression regulation. The nucleosome core particle comprises a histone octamer wrapped DNA, and can be modulated by the incoporation of distinct histone variants. Concerning H3, the replicative histone variants H3. 1 and H3. 2 contribute to the histone supply needed during DNA replication, while the histone variant H3. 3 is incorporated throughout the cell cycle. Interestingly, the literature highlights a link between H3. 3 and transcription. Moreover, the incorporation of H3. 3 depends on a specific assembly pathway that involves the histone chaperone HIRA. The aim of my research project was to determine whether H3. 3 and its incorporation via HIRA had specific roles. The context of embryonic development was an ideal situation giving that it requires the fine control of genes expression. The use of the vertebrate Xenopus laevis, which unlike mammals has only one replicative H3 variant: H3. 2, allowed me to assess the specific function of H3. 2 and H3. 3 during development. I showed that despite their similarity these two histone variants are not interchangeable. Remarkably, downregulation of H3. 3 expression in embryos or interference with its assembly pathway via HIRA leads to major developmental defects at gastrulation. This phenotype is accompanied by expression defects of mesodermal genes, including the marker Xbra. Moreover, these embryos show overall defects in their chromatin organization. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of H3. 3 incorporation into chromatin during a key developmental transition, gastrulation","This thesis proposes new methods for automatic musical spectrograms decomposition. Proposed decompositions are derived from Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which is a powerful rank reduction method renowned for providing decompositions on a few frequency patterns (extracted from the data) that generally have a perceptual meaning. However, NMF cannot efficiently model some kinds of temporal variations of non-stationary events usually found in musical spectrograms. This thesis proposes to introduce generative models of musical spectrograms relying on simple models of sound synthesis in order to take two kinds of common variations into account: the spectral envelope variations (plucked strings sounds, vocal-like sounds\u2026) and the fundamental frequency variations (vibrato, prosody\u2026). Introducing simple synthesis models in factorization methods makes it possible to propose decompositions able to model such variations: a source\u002ffilter model permits to take spectral variations of musical objects over time into account. A model of spectrogram with parametric harmonic atoms inspired by additive synthesis and another model inspired by wavetable synthesis which uses transformations of a single atom in order to generate all the possible fundamental frequencies of each instrument make it possible to model fundamental frequency variations. Applications of these new methods are also presented: an application of source separation and one of selective transformation of sound.","The automotive industry is preparing to deploy fleets of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which raises both technical and social challenges.Indeed, acceptance of AVs from both users and public authorities requires proof of the safety, reliability, and security of the proposed solutions.Major errors from AVs cannot be tolerated by society who expects a close-to-zero accident policy. Considering the wide uncertainty in the AV's environment, we cannot use the otherwise successful, systematic, and exhaustive verification techniques. Therefore, we need to rely on the assume-guarantee approach in which we can enforce some guarantees on the vehicle's safety under a set of assumptions on the environment.This work addresses this topic by considering a scenario-based approach for known unsafe scenarios.Here safety is restricted to the acceptance of the Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) standard, recently defined by ISO\u002fPAS 21448. One proposal to assess safety is to test AVs in real traffic and observe their behavior.As logical as it may sound, it is neither feasible nor sufficient because it poses significant risks to the environment and requires a lot of testing, which makes it non-scalable and that does not guarantee to cover 100% of the possible, however unlikely, scenarios.What we propose is to precisely define scenarios in which we describe the environmental conditions, and we provide the risks and the measures to be taken when a hazard is identified.In this thesis, we design a process based on formal modeling and verification to give sufficient guarantees and build concrete evidence to ensure the safety of AV. We propose a formal language, called Extensible Platform for Safety Analysis of AVs (EPSAAV), to bridge the gap between safety requirements, usually expressed in a natural language, and the actual code embedded inside the vehicle. We use EPSAAV in the fashion of Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) in a model-centric approach where artefacts and analyses are automatically derived from the model. We propose three instantiations of this language.First, we generate a safety report that can be used as a reference at the corporate level to disseminate the safety policy to be enforced in the company. Secondly, we generate a dedicated monitor to be interfaced with a chosen simulator. The operational semantics of this monitor are exploited in simulation to debug and identify ambiguities in scenarios.Typically this can be used by other teams to validate their work with regard to the global safety policy of the corporation.Third, we rely on the formal semantics of this language to detect inconsistencies that may arise from the safety requirements.For this purpose, we build a dedicated verification engine.Finally, to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we apply it to Renault-Nissan safety policy in full integration with the operational teams of Renault.","The recycling to the plasma membrane of receptors and lipids is tightly regulated and is essential for PM homeostasis, adhesion and cell migration. It requires small GTPase Rab proteins and their effectors. The MICAL-L1 protein, an effector of several Rabs including Rab 8, 11, 13 and 35, has been shown to play an important role in the recycling. Here, we report a novel interaction between MICAL-L1 and the BAR domain containing protein PACSIN3\u002fSyndapin3 that contributes to generate tubular recycling endosomes. MICAL-L1 is required for the localization of PACSIN3 to endosomal membranes. Importantly, disruption of MICAL-L1\u002fPACSIN3 interaction promotes the transferrin receptor (TfR) delivery back to the plasma membrane. The MICAL-L1\u002fPACSIN3 complex accumulates in elongated tubules that contain transferrin carriers. The dynamic of transferrin positive endosomes segregation from MICAL-L1\u002fPACSIN3 tubules suggests that MICAL-L1\u002fPACSIN3 complex controls TfR recycling endosomes delivery to the plasma membrane. Our data provide novel mechanistic insights on the dynamical regulation of the plasma membrane recycling pathway.","In many scientific areas, the size and the complexity of numerical simulations lead to make intensive use of massively parallel runs on High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. Such computers consist in a set of processing units (PU) where memory is distributed. Distribution of simulation data is therefore crucial: it has to minimize the computation time of the simulation while ensuring that the data allocated to every PU can be locally stored in memory. For most of the numerical simulations, the physical and numerical data are based on a mesh. The computations are then performed at the cell level (for example within triangles and quadrilaterals in 2D, or within tetrahedrons and hexahedrons in 3D). More specifically, computing and memory cost can be associated to each cell. In our context, where the mathematical methods used are finite elements or finite volumes, the realization of the computations associated with a cell may require information carried by neighboring cells. The standard implementation relies to locally store useful data of this neighborhood on the PU, even if cells of this neighborhood are not locally computed. Such non computed but stored cells are called ghost cells, and can have a significant impact on the memory consumption of a PU. The problem to solve is thus not only to partition a mesh on several parts by affecting each cell to one and only one part while minimizing the computational load assigned to each part. It is also necessary to keep into account that the memory load of both the cells where the computations are performed and their neighbors has to fit into PU memory. This leads to partition the computations while the mesh is distributed with overlaps. Explicitly taking these data overlaps into account is the problem that we propose to study.","Intracranial aneurysms are a hazard to human health because of their high rupture rate and fatal subsequence, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. In order to carry out a hemodynamic research in vitro on the intracranial aneurysm, a phantom is indispensable. Until now, rigid or simplified phantoms are mainly used in the literature, few among them possess sufficient properties compared with reality. The work of this thesis focuses on the methodology of manufacturing patient-specific phantoms of intracranial aneurysms as well as their implementation for different uses. The phantoms have an anatomical shape of patient\u2019s artery and an elastic wall. They are manufactured by applying an original rapid prototyping technique. The phantoms are examined and verified in different ways. In order to perform a hemodynamic research of the phantoms, a testing platform compatible with different imaging modalities has been designed and established. 2D phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography was applied in the hemodynamic study of the phantoms. The dynamic behavior of the artery wall, the 3D path-line of flow and the velocity field of flow were analyzed. The potential application in the clinical domain of the patient-specific phantoms was also tested in this thesis, simulations of intervention on intracranial aneurysms were carried out with the testing platform and the phantoms, the results of different treatment strategies were analyzed and compared.","Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) is a rare metabolic disease caused by glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) deficiency, due to mutations on the gene encoding G6Pase catalytic subunit (G6PC). This enzyme confers to the liver, kidneys and intestine the ability to produce glucose. Thus, patients with GSDIa are unable to ensure endogenous glucose production and suffer from severe hypoglycemia during fasting in the absence of nutritional control. In addition, G6Pase deficiency causes intracellular accumulation of glucose-6 phosphate in the liver and kidneys, leading to metabolic defects and the accumulation of glycogen and lipids. Over time, most adult patients suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), which can progress to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. This nephropathy is characterized in particular by tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, as well as by the development of cysts in the late stages. Moreover, patients develop hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis that may progress to the development of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas. The aim of my thesis was to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of renal pathology and cyst formation in GSDIa, by using mouse models where G6pc gene is specifically deleted in the kidneys (K.G6pc-\u002f- mice). While GSDIa is a disease characterized by glycogen accumulation in the liver and kidneys, we first showed that the development of fibrosis, which causes progressive loss of kidney function, was induced by intracellular accumulation of lipids, regardless of glycogen content. The molecular mechanism probably involved is the activation of the renin angiotensin system by lipid derivatives such as diacylglycerol, which induced the expression of the profibrotic factor TGF\u03b21 and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, the use of a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, i.e. fenofibrate, by decreasing renal lipid content, reduced the development of fibrosis and CKD evolution. Similarly, fenofibrate treatment prevented the accumulation of lipids in the liver and the development of liver damages that cause tumor development. Thus, the activation of lipid catabolism by PPAR\u03b1 agonists such as fenofibrate seems to be an interesting therapeutic strategy to reduce the progression of renal and hepatic diseases of GSDIa. The second part of my results suggest that the development of renal cysts in GSDI patients may be caused by an alteration of the primary cilia, a non-motile organelle that plays a key role in maintaining normal kidney structure and function. Indeed, defects in the primary cilia are involved in many polycystic kidney diseases. In summary, an increase in the length of the primary cilia was observed in the kidneys of K.G6pc-\u002f- mice, which could be explained by a deregulation of the expression of different proteins involved in cilia structure and function, compared to control mice.  We also demonstrated a metabolic reprogramming leading to a Warburg metabolism, characterized by the increased activation of aerobic glycolysis and the inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation and lipid production in K.G6pc-\u002f- mice. Thus, all these disorders would promote cell proliferation and cyst development, and could lead to the development of renal tumor, as recently observed in one K.G6pc-\u002f- mouse (out of 36 studied mice). In conclusion, we have shown that, in GSDI, the accumulation of lipids in the kidneys and liver that occurs secondary to G6Pase deficiency plays a key role in the development of hepatic and renal long-term complications. In addition, the Warburg like metabolic reprogramming taking place in the GSDIa kidneys, associated with a defect in the primary cilia, could be at the origin of cysts formation and renal tumors. These new studies, by providing a better understanding of the pathophysiology of long-term complications of GSDIa, offer new perspectives on therapeutic strategies to be developed for better management of patients","Fungi produce a wide variety of biologically active compounds\u002fmetabolites that could be used for medicinal and pharmaceutical purposes. Mitorubrines, members of the family of azaphilones, constitute a particularly interesting set of structurally diverse secondary metabolites, exhibiting a wide range of biological activities (e. G. Antimicrobial, antibacterial, antimalarial). This work describes the development of several mass spectrometry-based approaches to solve the natural structural diversity and complexity of azaphilones extracted from Hypoxylon fragiforme fungus. The first part of this manuscript is dedicated to the development and validation of an analytical methodology involving liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry for the efficient and accurate detection of trace-level azaphilones in complex fungal extracts. Further collision-induced dissociation and hydrogen\u002fdeuterium exchange experiments were performed to fully elucidate and characterize the azaphilones and their nitrogenized analogues from Hypoxylon fragiforme. The second part is devoted to the application of these different analytical strategies to the in-depth characterization of a novel family of secondary metabolites derived from azaphilones, the mitorubramines. Lastly, these different secondary metabolites were further purified to confirm their chemical structures by NMR spectroscopy","In contrast to targeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of wine volatiles, non-targeted GC-MS approaches take information of known and unknown compounds into account, are faster, inherently more comprehensive and give a more holistic representation of the sample composition. Although several non-targeted approaches have been developed, there is still a great demand for automated data processing tools, especially for complex multi-way data such as chromatographic data obtained from multichannel detectors (e.g. GC-MS chromatograms of multiple samples). This work therefore aimed at the development of data processing procedures for non-targeted GC-MS analysis of volatile wine compounds. The two developed approaches use basic matrix manipulation of segmented GC-MS chromatograms and PCA or PARAFAC multi-way modelling. The approaches take retention time shifts between samples into account and avoid peak integration. A demonstration of the new fingerprinting approaches is presented using an artificial GC-MS data set and an experimental full-scan GC-MS data set obtained for a set of experimental wines. Results of the new approaches were also compared to a references method. Furthermore, the combination of one of the developed GC-MS fingerprinting approaches with the fast sensory screening technique projective mapping was exploited as a powerful approach to simultaneously study the volatile composition and the sensory characteristics of experimental wines. This methodology was used to study the impact of different malolactic fermentation scenarios on two different Pinotage wine styles and for a full factorial investigation of the impact of grape vine age, must turbidity and yeast strain on the aroma of Riesling experimental wines.","In recent decades, the incidence of reproductive function abnormalities has increased. These defects are believed to be due to the exposure of organisms to a wide range of environmental contaminants such as bisphenol A (BPA). Experimental studies have shown that fetal development is a highly sensitive window to the exposure to these substances. Indeed, it is during this period that the germ line is set up and differentiated. Thus, complex and highly regulated molecular mechanisms come into play in order to transform a non-functional precursor cell into a germ cell that differentiates into a highly specialized haploid gamete. In females, one of the first illustrations of this germline differentiation is the initiation of the first division of meiosis (meiosis I) during fetal life leading to the production of a haploid and fertilizable oocyte in adulthood. Prophase I of meiosis (initiation and progression) is a period of extreme sensitivity to environmental contaminants such as bisphenol A (BPA) leading to irreversible defects in adulthood. Regarding the reprotoxicity of BPA, it has recently been banned from food containers. However, we remain exposed to other structural analogues whose germ cell is unknown. Thus, the purpose of this work is to explore the effects of fetal exposure to two bisphenols, BADGE and BPAF, on mammalian germ cells, particularly on oocytes and their precursors, but also to understand the mechanisms involved in the response to exposure. To do this, we exposed pregnant mice to bisphenols in drinking water during the second half of gestation. Ovarian analysis shows that exposure to bisphenols induces oocyte depletion, formation of multiovocyte follicles and increases aneuploid oocyte and chiasmas levels. Like BPA, BADGE and BPAF cause meiotic defects such as delayed initiation and progression to meiosis. This is also observed in the human fetal ovary studied using the human fetal gonad xenograft model developed by our laboratory, which allows long-term exposure to bisphenols. Male germ cells also have a differentiation time delay characterized by a delay in entering the quiescence phase.These delays appear to be correlated with the alteration of expression and\u002for mRNA splicing of meiotic genes at the beginning of the meiotic program. These defects seem to be the consequence of oxidative DNA damage induced by bisphenols in precursor germ cells. Similarly, we have observed that in the absence of OGG1, a DNA glycosylase involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine, the differentiation phase is delayed regardless of gender.All in all, these results provide further proof that fetal exposure to bisphenols impairs reproductive functions at adulthood, probably as a consequence of oxidative stress generation in germ cells.","Sporulation is a phenomenon present in many microorganisms, usually involved in the mechanisms of dispersion and\u002for resistance to unfavorable environmental conditions. Sporulation occurs in some Frankia strains (a diazotrophic actinobacteria) during their symbiotic interaction with actinorhizal plants, which is paradoxical in a context where the bacterium has a favorable ecological niche for its development. These particular Frankia strains, called Sp+, represent a unique model of symbiont capable of sporulation within the host cells. The ecological role and the evolutionary meanings of this in-planta sporulation still remain understood. The two main objectives of this thesis aimed to (i) understand the influence of in-planta sporulation on the symbiotic capacity of Sp+ strains in terms of infectivity and competitiveness and (ii) understand the impact of this sporulation on the functioning of the symbiotic complex by a metabolic profiling approach. These studies have confirmed the symbiotic characteristics of Sp+ strains (greater infectivity and competitiveness) and have shown significant differences in the primary and secondary metabolism of the symbiotic complex associated with the presence of Frankia spores","PABPN1 is an RNA binding protein involved in many post-transcriptional RNA regulation mechanisms. A pathological expansion of the GCN triplet in the gene leads to a muscular dystrophy called Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). The molecular mechanisms leading to a small expansion in an ubiquitous protein to a disease, where only few muscles are impaired are still not fully understood. The main pathological hallmark is the presence in the myonuclei of nuclear aggregates of the PABPN1 protein. Today there is no cure for OPMD patients. In this context the projects developed during this thesis have been to 1) study the molecular mechanisms involved in OPMD, 2) study the contribution of the nuclear aggregates in the physiopathology of the disease and 3) develop a gene therapy strategy. We found mitochondrial dysfunctions present in OPMD muscles and we decipher the molecular mechanism involved. Study of PABPN1 aggregates in OPMD has highlighted splicing deregulation events. Among them TNNT3, a RNA which encodes a muscle specific protein is deregulated and we found that the pre-mRNA is trapped in nuclear aggregates outsides speckles nuclear domain containing its natural splicing factor (SC35), leading to an imbalance of the ratio of two mutually exclusives exons of the transcript. The gene therapy strategy developed is a replacement strategy that consists of silencing PABPN1 using RNAi and also bringing a novel version of the protein using a cDNA, untargeted by RNAi thanks to the genetic code redundancy, which encodes a wild-type form of PABPN1. We obtained promising results both in vitro and in vivo in mice OPMD model with a rescue of the pathological phenotype.","Chemical ligation involves the linking of molecules in covalent manner to form a novel complex having the combined properties of its individual components. Thus, natural or synthetic compounds with their individual activities can be chemically combined to create unique substances possessing carefully engineered characteristics. A field of especial interest in such ligation procedures is protein labeling.To accelerate the discovery of new bioselective ligation reactions, we designed a screening system for fast assigning of the selectivity and reactivity of a given functional group owards series of UVGtraceable amino acid derivatives. As a result of our screening a promising cysteineGselective scaffold\u20133Garylpropiolonitrile (APN)\u2013was identified. Its remarkable selectivity, high reactivity and of both starting and addition products in aqueous and organic media represents an important advantage compared to methodologies classically used for cysteine tagging. StructureGreactivity study allowed us to optimise its properties and toprepare a series of funcional probes, one of which was used for!an accurate test of APN selectivity on model mixtures of peptides. Furthermore, APN were found to possess an elevated selectivity towards selenocysteine:ararebut very important amino!acid found in many active enzymes.A series of APN was tested for their inhibitory activity towards one of such selenocysteineGcontaining enzyme\u2013thioredoxine reductase\u2013and was found to possess promising activities, which however still must be!optimised.Lastly, a screening system devoted to the discovery of reagents reactivity towards a sequence of amino acid residue was elaborated and allowed us to determine presumable discrepancy in reactivity of APN depending on the amino acid residue neighbouring the cysteine moiety. Such difference in reactivity may represent an important advantage for bioconjugation, and is currently under further investigation.","Opening of the canopy exhibits advantages (resources availability) but also new constraints (wind, higher evaporative demand). Rather well documented in saplings, response dynamics to canopy opening is less known in large trees. The thesis aims to identify the dynamics of responses to canopy opening in beech trees suppressed during long periods. Adopted approach is multi-disciplinary and multi-scale, based on a retrospective analysis of axial and radial growth, anatomy and biomechanical traits. For suppressed trees, the competition for light results in preferential allocation of biomass to axial growth in comparison with radial growth resulting in trees with high slenderness. Moreover, one third of suppressed trees are sagging. After the release, high slenderness presents a biomechanical risk: 15 from 36 trees are broken by the wind two years after the release. To increase their safety against the wind-break, trees reduce their axial growth during four years after the release and boost their radial growth reaching a stabilisation plateau after two years likely due to the size and resources limitations. Trees with lean angle higher than 6\u00b0 up-right after the release. The tree ring hydraulic conductivity increases and stabilises after two years also. The dynamics of responses to canopy opening are therefore clearly trait dependent. Moreover, integrative approach highlighted the importance of size in the responses to canopy opening: while saplings adjust both wood tissue properties and tree geometry, large trees rely only on geometry adjustments.","We present a numerical procedure for the matching of 3D MRI. The problem of image matching is addressed through the usual distinction between the deformation model and the matching criterion. The deformation model is based on the theory of computational anatomy and the set of deformations is a group of diffeomorphisms generated by integrating vector fields. The discrepancy between the two images is evaluated through comparisons of level lines represented by a differential current in the dual of a space of vector fields. This representation leads to a quickly computable non-local criterion. Then, the optimisation method is based on the minimization of the criterion following the idea of the so-called sub-optimal algorithm. We take advantage of the eulerian and periodical description of the algorithm to get an efficient numerical procedure. This algorithm can be used to deal with 3d MR images and numerical experiences are presented. In an other part, we focus on theoretical properties of the algorithm. We begin by simplifying the equation representing the evolution of the deformed image and we use the theory of viscosity solutions to study the simplified equation. The second issue we are interested in is the change-point estimation for a gaussian sequence with change in the variance parameter. The main feature of our model is that we work with infill data and the nature of the data can evolve jointly with the size of the sample. The usual approach suggests to introduce a contrast function and using the point of its maximum as a change-point estimator. We first get an information about the asymptotic fluctuations of the contrast function around its mean function. Then, we focus on the change-point estimator and more precisely on the convergence of this estimator. The most direct application concerns the detection of change in the Hurst parameter of a fractional brownian motion. The estimator depends on a parameter p \u003e 0, generalizing the usual choice p = 2. We present some results illustrating the advantage of a parameter p \u003c 2.","Service-oriented engineering is an emerging software development paradigm for distributed collaborative applications. Such an application is made up of several entities abstracted as services, each of them being for example a Web application, a Web service, or even a human. The services can be developed independently and are composed to achieve common requirements through interactions among them. Service choreographies define such requirements from a global perspective, based on interactions among a set of participants. This thesis aims to formalize the problems and attempts to develop a framework by which service choreographies can be developed correctly for both top-down and bottom-up approaches. It consists in analyzing the relation between a choreography specification and a choreography implementation at both model level and real implementation level. Particularly, it concerns the composition\u002fdecomposition service design, the verification, and the testing of choreography implementation. The first key point of our framework is to support value-passing among services by using symbolic technique and SMT solver. It overcomes false negatives or state space explosion issues due by abstracting or limiting the data domain of value-passing in existing approaches. The second key point is the black-box passive testing of choreography implementation. It does not require neither to access to source codes nor to make the implementation unavailable during the testing process. Our framework is fully implemented in our toolchains, which can be downloaded or used online at address: http:\u002f\u002fschora.lri.fr.","Perovskite oxides are studied since decades for their magnetic properties and more recently for their electrocatalytic properties in the context of energy conversion, within fuel cells and water electrolyzers, for instance. In this work, we have aimed at developing new perovskite-based electrocatalysts operating in aqueous media, by targeting nanoscaled perovskites able to interact with their environment and then to exhibit stimuli-dependent electrocatalytic properties. This work was then at crossroad between the development of synthesis strategies, the design of nanomaterials, the study of their electrochemical and magnetic properties and of their interplay. We first describe a synthesis strategy suitable to reach quaternary perovskites by using molten salt media, innovative microwave heating and precise tuning of the oxo-basicity of the melt. We then address the relationship between magnetism and electrocatalysis on the case study of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 nanocrystals derived from molten salts, through the development of an original set-up enabling triggering changes in the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis by application of a magnetic field. We especially stress out the important of the composition of the electrolyte for magnetic enhancement of electrocatalytic activity. Finally, we address another way to trigger \u201cexternally\u201d the properties of nanoscaled perovskite oxides, by developing a synthesis of doped perovskite nanocrystals and then by triggering under reducing conditions the exsolution of the metal cation dopants as metal nanoparticles at the surface of perovskite nanocrystal hosts, for the first time.","This thesis aims to build coordinate systems for shapes i.e. finite-dimensional metric spaces where shapes are represented by vectors. The goal of building such coordinate systems is to allow and facilitate the statistical analysis of shape data sets. The end-game motivation of our work is to predict and sub-type Alzheimer\u2019s disease, based in part on knowledge extracted from banks of brain medical images. Even if these data banks are longitudinal, their variability remains mostly due to the large and normal inter-individual variability of the brain. The variability due to the progression of pathological alterations is of much smaller amplitude. The central objective of this thesis is to develop a coordinate system adapted for the statistical analysis of longitudinal shape data sets, able to disentangle these two sources of variability. As shown in the literature, the parallel transport operator can be leveraged to achieve this desired disentanglement, for instance by defining the notion of exp-parallel curves on a manifold. Using this tool on shape spaces comes however with theoretical and computational challenges, tackled in the first part of this thesis. Finally, if shape spaces are commonly equipped with a manifold-like structure in the field of computational anatomy, the underlying classes of diffeomorphisms are however most often largely built and parameterized without taking into account the data at hand. The last major objective of this thesis is to build deformation-based coordinate systems where the parameterization of deformations is adapted to the data set of interest.","Information geometry is a mathematical theory that applies methods of differential geometryin the fields of statistics and information theory. It is a very promising technique foranalyzing iterative algorithms used in digital communications. In this thesis, we apply this technique, in addition to the proximal point algorithm, to iterative algorithms. First, we have found some geometrical and proximal point interpretations in the case of an iterative algorithmfor computing the capacity of discrete and memoryless channel, the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.Interesting results obtained motivated us to extend this application to a larger class of iterative algorithms. Then, we have studied in details iterative decoding algorithm of Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) in order to analyse and propose some ameliorations of the classical decoding case. We propose a proximal point interpretation of this iterative process and find the link with some well known decoding algorithms, the Maximum likelihood decoding.","Additive Manufacturing (AM) recently became an attractive manufacturing process in several industrial fields such as aeronautics, aerospace and automotive. The exploitation of AM processes for the nuclear industry is currently being studied in different countries. The AM enables the creation of optimized parts with complex geometries impossible to manufacture with conventional processes. This thesis aims to determine the potential contribution of AM processes for the production of metal components for various nuclear applications including future Generation IV reactors. First, the microstructural and mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel parts built by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process are presented. Three thematics were assessed in this study: the SLM process parameters, the powder characteristics and two post heat treatments (700 \u00b0 C-1h and hot isostatic pressing: 1100 \u00b0 C-3h under 1800 Bar). Their effects on microstructure and mechanical properties were analyzed. Tensile properties of 316L steel specimens were measured and compared to those of forged 316L steel described in the nuclear field by RCC-MRX standards. The results obtained are superior to those of the standard and comparable to those of a forged steel. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of interactions between the process parameters, the microstructure and the mechanical properties.","The use of sandwich panels in civil engineering is becoming increasingly important thanks to some certain advantages as a good stiffness to weight ratio and easy implementation. However, their growth is hindered by weak points as:  significant shear deflection, indentation and buckling of thin composite skins, and fire issues when the panels are made of polymers. Utilization of ribs or connectors trough the core can be a suitable answer to the shear issue. When the skins are made of mineral materials, the panels become fireproof and buckling is avoided by the appropriate compressive behaviour of such materials.This thesis deals with the mechanical behaviour of a sandwich panel composed of hybrid skins (mineral layer and glass fibre reinforced polymer layer) and GFRP truss (glass fibre reinforced polymer) core. The study was split up into three parts: the mechanical behaviour of the GFRP panel, the interface issue between the materials that compose the hybrid skins, and the mechanical response of the large-scale hybrid panel. The cited parts were studied after a mechanical characterisation of each panel component at the material scale. First, the mechanical behaviour of the GFRP structure was experimentally studied through compression, shear and three-point bending tests. Then, a finite element simulation using Hashin model was performed. The model was validated by comparison with the experimental curves of the cited tests. The visualization of the damage evolution confirmed experimental observations of failure modes. At the end of the chapter, the influence of connectors\u2019 geometrical and mechanical parameters (as modulus, inclination, diameter and square density) was studied. The interface between the GFRP layer and the mineral one was first experimentally characterised through tensile and push-out tests to extract the mechanical parameters of mode I and II. Six interface configurations were tested to select the one that mechanically performed the best. In the first four configurations, the roughness of the substrate was increased to improve the mechanical cling. In the last two configurations, we attempted to improve the chemical adherence by applying a primary adhesive layer and by addition of polyvinyl alcohol. A three points bending test was performed on two configurations of hybrid panels: with the reference interface and the one that mechanically performed the best. A cohesive zone model was introduced to predict the interface damage. It was validated by comparison with the experimental data. The mechanical behaviour of large-scale hybrid panels was studied in the last chapter. Experimentally, three configurations were tested: the core thickness and the fibre weight in the GFRP skins were changed. At this scale, two interface configurations were also tested. The proposed numerical model was validated regarding the large-scale experimental responses. Then, it was used to design sandwich structure against fa\u00e7ade panels criteria. For a span of 2 m, the wind criterion was satisfied with a core thickness of 5 cm. The panel weight doesn\u2019t exceed 21 kg\u002fm\u00b2. Finally, the use of the studied sandwich structure as pre-slab panels was numerically assessed through a case study","N-day vulnerabilities are public, recently disclosed, but not well-known software and hardware vulnerabilities. Past n-day vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, Shellshock, and EternalBlue already had important real-world impact on thousands of information systems and organizations across the world. One difficulty for proper defense against n-day vulnerabilities is that during the first days after a vulnerability disclosure, preliminary information about the vulnerability is not available in a machine readable format, delaying the use of automated vulnerability management processes. This situation creates a period of time when only expensive manual analysis can be used to react to new vulnerabilities because no data is available for cheaper automated analysis yet. We propose several contributions to automatically analyze newly disclosed vulnerabilities to predict inherent properties such as the software or hardware they affect, and automatically evaluate the risk they pose in the context of a specific information system. We highlight how our contributions take part in a greater end-to-end strategy aiming at mitigating the risk faced by information system because of n-day vulnerabilities.","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are extra-galactic transient phenomena that continue to puzzle scientists, 50 years after their discovery. Associated to violent events like the death of massive stars, they consist of two phases: the prompt emission, a burst of gamma-ray photons lasting typically few seconds and the afterglow, detectable in X-ray, visible and radio wavelengths up to few days after the prompt GRB. Being some of the most luminous phenomena in the Universe, GRBs are extremely interesting: they are among the farthest cosmic sources observed, representing a unique mean to probe stellar populations and the intra and inter-galactic medium at the highest redshifts. However, because of their short duration, their unpredictable times and sky localization, the study of GRBs remains challenging, even for modern astronomy. The Sino-French mission SVOM, to be launched end of 2023, encompasses two wide-field (ECLAIRs and GRM) and two narrow-field (MXT and VT) instruments for detecting, characterizing and localizing the GRB prompt and afterglow emissions. SVOM also benefits from three dedicated ground telescopes (GWAC, C-GFT and COLIBRI) and an antennae network, allowing to alert the scientific community within few minutes after the prompt emission detection for an optimal follow-up. My work focused on ECLAIRs, the wide-field hard X-ray telescope of SVOM. Using its coded mask and on-board computer, ECLAIRs will detect in near real-time the GRB prompt emission and get a crude localization from it. Thanks to its low energy threshold at 4 keV, the telescope will be perfectly suited for the detection of interesting GRB populations such as X-ray Flashes or high-redshift GRBs. My thesis has been focused on the evaluation of ECLAIRs performances in space: I have combined instrumental effects with models of the background sky emission and GRB\u002fX-ray sources to accurately simulate the instrument data stream. These simulations have been used for example to evaluate the sensitivity of ECLAIRs to various types of transients, to calculate the GRB detection rate expected during the mission, and as a support to evaluate the science impact of various configuration parameters of the instrument. They have also been used as a framework for developing alternative trigger algorithm solutions to the on-board software, motivated by the unique ability of ECLAIRs to transfer all the events recorded on-board to the ground. Relying on simulated background orbits and GRBs, I have used a neural-network architecture suited for the anomaly detection on time series. This method may become part of an offline trigger able to detect transients missed by the on-board algorithm. Another application presented in the manuscript is the evaluation of ECLAIRs sensitivity to short high-energy (HE) transients coming from our local Universe (z\u003c0.3). After providing a characterization of this population, we demonstrate that ECLAIRs will be able to detect the large majority of it. We also discuss the potential synergies with other SVOM instruments and multi-messenger observatories. As a side work, I have explored the possible connections between the BHs created during long GRBs and the mergers of binary black holes observed through gravitational waves (GW) emissions. This study was motivated by the release of the latest GW catalog GWTC-3, containing 79 BH mergers. From the comparison of their redshift evolution and expected rate, we have shown that these two populations are most probably distinct. To conclude, my thesis has provided a complete set of simulation tools for ECLAIRs with concrete applications such as the testing of the flight software and the SVOM pipelines. I have shown that ECLAIRs will be able to detect and localize unique populations of GRBs and other short high-energy transients, enabling their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger characterization by SVOM and worldwide astronomical observatories.","The myotonic dystrophies (DM) are the most common forms of muscular dystrophies in adults, characterized by several symptoms such as cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias, fatals in 30% of DM patients. The molecular causes of DM cardiac defects are unknown. The RNA gain of function involving a sequestration of MBNL, alternatives splicing factors by large RNAs containing large (C)CUG, leading to alternative splicing defects. By microarray analysis, we identified and confirmed the specific decrease of miR-1, leading to misregulation of connexin 43 and cardiac calcium channel Cav1.2 expressions in DM patients\u2019 hearts. By RNA-Sequencing of samples from DM and non-DM patients hearts, we have shown misregulation of more than 100 alternative splicing, such as the most interesting splicing alteration which is that of exons 6A\u002f6B of SCN5A, the maincardiac sodium channel. We have shown this splicing is regulated by MBNL, and we have confirmed the abnormal inclusion of exon 6A instead of exon 6B in SCN5A mRNA in heart of DM patients, resulting in the decrease of SCN5A channel activity. This decrease could explain the cardiac defects of DM patients.","The objective of this thesis was the characterization of the recent tectonic extension in Tunisia. The study concerned the rifts of the Tunisian Atlas and the extensive structures of the Sahel. Various methods of structural analysis were adopted such as the field tectonic analysis, the Stress inversion from faults using the Direct Inverse method, the statistical analysis of the fracturing and the seismic data. Field observations show that the rifts borders are structured by NW-SE-trending normal faults having various sizes. These rifts are filled by \"Post-Tortonian\" sediments which are affected by synsedimentary extensive structures related to rifting. The quaternary deposits, tectonically stable, seem to be \"post-rift\". Early halokinetics is shown by the seismic data in the current site of Atlasic rifts. The recent diapiric reactivation assumes a significant role in the localisation of the deformation during the major tectonic extension responsible to rifting in the Tunisian Atlas. The microtectonic analysis in the various study zones, in Atlasic rifts and the Sahel, shows that the majority of faults are dip-slip, formed by a NE-SW-trending major tectonic extension at the end-Miocene and Pliocene age (s. L). A minor NW-SE-trending extension, sub-perpendicular and posterior to the major extension, seems to be the result of a transient permutations of \u03c32 and \u03c33 axes during the main extensional event; the Quaternary age would be characterized by another minor NE-SW-trending extensive movement. The analogue modelling is adopted to simulate the uniaxial extension in Tunisia on the crustal scale in presence of evaporites (four-layer model: Sand\u002fSilicone\u002fSand\u002fSilicone +barytes). This experimental method suggested that this recent extension would be due to a NE-SW-trending crustal stretching involving a thinning of continental crust. This tectonic movement resulted in a principal rifts zone, corresponding to the Pantelleria rifts zone, and the small rifts of Tunisian Atlas. All these rifts are sub-perpendicular to the extensional trend. The small rifts are not very deep and implanted on a d\u00e9collement level formed by the Triassic evaporites. The localization of these small rifts is guided by pre-existent Triassic diapirs situated in the current rifts zone. The recent extensional event in Tunisia is integrated in the geodynamic context of the North African margin; in fact, this tectonic extension in Tuniso-Sicilian zone would be due to migration of the Ionien block towards the Hellenic subduction zone.","The Hatay Triple Junction (HTJ) cannot be described by a simple model with three major plates as proposed by previous studies. A more complex block model is proposed in this study by adding the Iskenderun block and Amanous micro block, the Karasu fault and Karatas-Osmaniye fault being defined as individual faults not as the extension of other major faults in the region. Our modeling assumes that the Maras triple junction is formed by the connection of the Karatas-Osmaniye Fault (KOF) with the Karasu Fault (KF) and the East Anatolian Fault (EAF). The KF shows a sinistral slip rate of 4.0\u00b11.0 mm\u002fyr and a compressional behavior with a compression rate of 2.1-2.7 mm\u002fyr which contradicts the extensional nature proposed by previous studies. The EAF shows pure left lateral slip rate of 9.0\u00b10.3 mm\u002fyr with no significant extension or compression; the DSF has a slip rate of 3.5\u00b10.3 mm\u002fyr over the northern and southern segments; the KOF has a 3.6\u00b10.7 mm\u002fyr; the Cyprus arc has a clear compressional deformation with a revers slip rate of 2.0-5.0 mm\u002fyr and with no significant strike-slip component. The relative Euler poles are estimated in this block modeling, we define the Anatolia-Arabia Euler pole at (27.61\u00b10.98 \u00b0N, 45.127\u00b12.45 \u00b0E, 0.391\u00b1 0.056\u00b0\u002fMyr), and (31.012\u00b11.51 \u00b0N, 46.464\u00b14.44 \u00b0E, 0.202\u00b10.067\u00b0\u002fMyr) Sinai-Arabia Euler pole.","The control of microstructure and surface morphology is essential for the thin films to be applied in optical and acoustic devices. Thin films of TiO2, LaNiO3 and ZnO and their heterostructures in this work were obtained by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The optimization of deposition parameters, such as temperature, total chamber pressure, O2 partial pressure and growth rate, led to high structural quality of functional thin films and their heterostructures. The orientation of epitaxial ZnO and TiO2 thin films was tuned not only through lattice matching with various substrates, but as well through deposition conditions. The optical quality of TiO2 films was mostly optimized through elimination of microstructural defects and increasing oxygen non-stoichiometry. It was shown that microstructural and lattice defects in polycrystalline and epitaxial films played a key role in optical propagation losses. Effect of substrate polarity on the structural, optical and acoustic properties of ZnO-based thin films was studied, as well. The sacrificial and\u002for seed layers were identified for heterogeneous int\u00e9gration of functional acoustical and optical films with semiconductor substrates.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system involving inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. Remarkable advances have been achieved in drug development with the approval of several disease-modifying therapies able to reduce the number of relapses. However, halting the progression of the disease is still an unmet need and there is currently no drug approved to repair the damaged myelin. Developing a new drug is a complex effort involving various fields, including pharmacology. Preclinical drug development of small molecules encompasses the different activities needed to bring a compound from drug discovery to initiation of human clinical trials. Preclinical drug development starts with the identification and validation of a good drug target, followed by the identification and optimization of the best compound candidates. In this complex process, the study of drug-effects in vivo in appropriate animal models is central. Targeting ACKR3 - also known as CXCR7, an atypical chemokine receptor - has been postulated as a potential therapeutic approach in MS by reducing neuroinflammation and promoting remyelination. However, so far, no ACKR3 antagonist inhibiting beta-arrestin signaling has been identified nor investigated in vivo in animal disease models. This doctoral thesis describes the pharmacological preclinical development of ACT-1004-1239, a potent, selective, insurmountable, and orally available first-in-class ACKR3 antagonist. ACKR3 has been described as a scavenger receptor for its chemokine ligands, namely CXCL11 and CXCL12. After the characterization of the pharmacokinetic\u002fpharmacodynamic (PK\u002fPD) properties of ACT-1004-1239, with the measurement of plasma CXCL12 as PD biomarker, its immunomodulatory properties were evaluated in a proof of mechanism model of acute lung injury in mice. These results demonstrated the pivotal role of ACKR3 on immune cell infiltration to sites of inflammation. The current hypothesis is that ACKR3, by scavenging its ligands, enables the formation of CXCL11 and CXCL12 concentration gradients from the blood to the site of inflammation and hence immune cell migration to inflamed tissue. Furthermore, the efficacy of ACT-1004-1239 was assessed in preclinical MS models such as the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse models. These studies confirmed the immunomodulatory effect of ACT-1004-1239 on the migration of immune cells to the CNS. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo, ACT-1004-1239 increased the number of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and enhanced myelination in the cuprizone model. These results provide evidence that ACT-1004-1239 both reduces neuroinflammation and enhances remyelination, underscoring the clinical potential of ACT-1004-1239 for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.","Memory is commonly defined as the ability to encode, store, and recall information we perceived. As we experience the world, we sense stimuli, we witness events, we ascertain facts, we study concepts, and we acquire skills. Although memory is an innate and familiar human behaviour, the interior workings of the brain which provide us with such faculties are far from being fully unravelled. Experimental studies have shown that during memory tasks, certain brain structures exhibit synchronous activity which is thought to be correlated with the short-term maintenance of salient stimuli. The objective of this thesis is to use biologically-inspired mathematical modelling and simulations of neural activity to shed some light on the mechanisms enabling the emergence of these memory-related synchronous oscillations. We focus in particular on hippocampal mnemonic activity during the awake state, and the amnesia and paradoxical memory consolidation occurring under general anaesthesia. We begin by introducing a detailed model of a type of persistent-firing pyramidal neuron commonly found in the CA3 and CA1 areas of the hippocampus. Stimulated with a brief transient current pulse, the neuron displays persistent activity maintained solely by cholinergic calcium-activated non-specific (CAN) receptors, and outlasting the stimulus for long delay periods (\u003e 30s). Our model neuron and its parameters are derived from experimental in-vitro recordings of persistent firing hippocampal neurons carried out by our collaborators Beate Knauer and Motoharu Yoshida at the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany. Subsequently, we turn our attention to the dynamics of a population of such interconnected pyramidal-CAN neurons. We hypothesise that networks of persistent firing neurons could provide the neural mechanism for the maintenance of memory-related hippocampal oscillations. The firing patterns elicited by this network are in accord with both experimental recordings and modelling studies. In addition, the network displays self-sustained oscillatory activity in the theta frequency. When connecting the pyramidal-CAN network to fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, the dynamics of the model reveal that feedback inhibition improves the robustness of fast theta oscillations, by tightening the synchronisation of the pyramidal CAN neurons. We demonstrate that, in the model, the frequency and spectral power of the oscillations are modulated solely by the cholinergic mechanisms mediating the intrinsic persistent firing, allowing for a wide range of oscillation rates within the theta band. This is a biologically plausible mechanism for the maintenance of synchronous theta oscillations in the hippocampus which aims at extending the traditional models of septum-driven hippocampal rhythmic activity. In addition, we study the disruptive effects of general anaesthesia on hippocampal gamma-frequency oscillations. We present an in-depth study of the action of anaesthesia on neural oscillations by introducing a new computational model which takes into account the four main effects of the anaesthetic agent propofol GABAergic hippocampal interneurons. Our results indicate that propofol-mediated tonic inhibition contributes to enhancing network synchronisation in a network of hippocampal interneurons. This enhanced synchronisation could provide a possible mechanism supporting the occurrence of intraoperative awareness, explicit memory formation, and even paradoxical excitation under general anaesthesia, by facilitating the communication between brain structures which should supposedly be not allowed to do so when anaesthetised. In conclusion, the findings described within this thesis provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying mnemonic neural activity, both during wake and anaesthesia, opening compelling avenues for future work on clinical applications tackling neurodegenerative memory diseases, and anaesthesia monitoring","Microsporidia are unicellular eukaryotic parasites related to fungi and responsible for parasitosis in many host organisms including humans. Microsporidia use different strategies to adhere to and invade host cells, among which the extrusion of a polar tube harpooning and carrying the infectious form inside the host cells. To date, only a few proteins have been identified as involved in adhesion, but their neutralization by inhibition assays is not sufficient to completely eliminate infection, suggesting the involvement of other molecular actors. In this study, we combined surfomics and in silico approaches in order to identify new protein candidates potentially involved in the infection processes of two microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Anncaliia algerae), and to determine their role in infection by functional inhibition assays. These approaches allowed the identification of Ricin-B-like proteins, EcRBLL-1, AaRBLL-1 and AaRBLL-2, which are localized at the spore wall and\u002for at the polar tube of the spore. Functional inhibition assays, based on the use of recombinant proteins and antibodies associated with the 3 proteins, revealed a significant decrease in the proliferation of E. cuniculi and A. algerae, suggesting their roles in the adhesion\u002finfection process. In parallel, the study of other proteins EcSWP7, EcSWP9, EcSWP12 and EcSWP26, identified in support of literature data and complemented by in silico analysis, led to demonstrate a parietal localization of the spore and the polar tube in E. cuniculi. Finally, the surfomics approach by SDS extraction of the spore wall proteins allowed the selection of 6 candidate proteins (AaRBLL-1, AaP6BE05, AaP13YM, AaP696T, AaP3569, AaP04039, AaP03248) in A. algerae to evaluate their role in infection. The anti-microsporidian effect of a polysaccharide from the red microalga Porphyridium marinum (PM) was also explored in order to understand the mechanisms of action involved. It seems that this compound can act on the surface of host cells and thus block the adhesion of spores to cells. In parallel, a screening of new polysaccharides was carried out to search for new anti-microsporidian molecules that could act in combination with the PM polysaccharide, in particular to treat Nosema ceranae, responsible for the nosemosis of bees. Three polysaccharides were able to significantly reduce the parasite load of infected bees.","Electrostatic forces increase the collection efficiency of fine particles in electrets filters; The objective of the present, carried with industrial, was double: (1) evaluate the response of this class of dielectric materials to a deposit of charges generated by corona discharge in a \"triode\"-type electrode system; (2) understand the mechanisms of charge decay, by measuring the electric potential at the surface of the samples, using a vibrating capacitor probe connected at the electrostatic voltmeter. The acquisition and processing of data were performed using a virtual instrument (LabView) and routines developed in Matlab environment. The tests were performed on samples of polypropylene non-woven fabrics made of fibers of different sizes and orientations. These intrinsic characteristics of the materials affect the initial level and the dynamics of the surface potential. The behaviour of the filter media is also influenced by the following factors: level and polarity of the potential of the grid electrode that controls the charge deposition; the temperature at which the sample is preheated; the relative humidity of ambient air. The initial level of charge of the fibrous media is limited by partial discharges, due to local intensification of the electric field. At high temperatures, the trapping of charges is more stable, while the humidity increases the conduction of charge to the electrode connected to ground. Successive deposits of electrical charges significantly reduce the potential decay and increase the stability of the charge state of the filters.","Tube hydroforming requires the employment of expensive tooling and its industrial development makes an intensive use of finite element simulations. For these simulations, we need plastic material data. The material behavior, in forming, depends on the loading mode. Thus, several characterization tests such as uniaxial tensile test, the bulging test on sheet and tube, are investigated in this work.The works are conducted in the context of a pragmatic approach. The goal is to offer simple methods for implementation in an industrial setting based on a limited number of tests, a simple experimental method and an efficient method for post-processing experimental results. In addition, we limit ourselves to classical material models, available in any FE code, such as the Swift\u2019s hardening law and the Hill 1948 plastic criterion.After the introduction of the different kind of hydroforming and the fundamentals on the plastic behavior of materials, the experimental tests are presented. There are many ways for post-processing the experimental results of these advanced testing methods. The conventional method is chosen for post-processing the experimental results obtained with the tensile test ; for the sheet bulging test, the method recommended by Ko\u00e7 et al. is used and the model proposed by Boudeau and Mal\u00e9cot\u2019s is adopted for tube bulging test.The different tests are carried out on an austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 and, distinct hardening curves are obtained. Numerical simulations of the tests and a tube hydroforming operation are performed with the different hardening law. The FE results are compared; the comparisons are led on the resulting bulged sheet or tube and on the thickness distribution. Finally, the influence of the initial anisotropy in tube hydroforming is studied through a full Design Of Experiences.Keywords: hydroforming, material characterization, tube, F.E. simulation, experiment","Industrial production process of cellulases involves the aerobic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei, as it displays a high secretion capacity. Scaling-up this process is a prerequisite to allow the ethanol production processes from lignocellulosic biomass to be economically viable. However, this scale-up is challenging because the filamentous morphology of the fungus increases the medium viscosity. This leads to spatial and temporal heterogeneities within the culture, especially in terms of dissolved oxygen concentration, which negatively affect the enzyme production. This thesis aimed at studying the effects of mixing, by considering fluid dynamic stress and dissolved oxygen gradients, on T. reesei physiology and ability to produce cellulases. The scale-down methodology was employed to reproduce at bench scale the constraints encountered in large scale bioreactors. The impact of fluid dynamic stress on cellulases production was considered in continuous mode, using two levels of fluid dynamic stress. Our results showed that the intracellular proteins synthesis and the cellulases production by T. reesei were both affected by high fluid dynamic stress, but in a\tlimited way. The effect of the oxygen gradients was studied in fed-batch cultures using three scale-down approaches: Two Bizone systems, consisting of two connected bioreactors, the biggest one being aerated and the smallest one not (or conversely) and a single bioreactor to which a dynamic variation of the pO2 was applied. Cellulases production was reduced when the fungus encountered anaerobiosis. However, small bubbles included in the viscous medium helped maintaining a low level of dissolved oxygen, thus limiting the deleterious effect of anaerobiosis. Our work also highlighted the rise of a non-producing variant of T. reesei when the population faced hypoxia. This sub-population induced a strong reduction of the bioprocess performances. In addition, the development of original models highlighted the importance of considering the hold-up due to small bubbles, to properly describe T. reesei behavior. Finally, this work demonstrated the \u201crobustness\u201d of the fungus when it faces fluid dynamic stress and heterogeneities that are likely to appear at large scale.","The transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences capable of catalyze its own movement and to enter into new regions of the genome. In the present study we studied Helena, a LINE element that is at different stages of its evolutionary cycle and  therefore,  it  is  a  good  model  for  studies  of  TEs  evolutionary dynamics.  Through bioinformatics analysis of 12 Drosophila species which have their genomes sequenced, we found Helena in different stages of its evolutionary cycle, that varies of at least one full active copy (D. mojavensis) an putatively complete copy, but inactive (D. simulans) to highly degenerate (D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae and D. virilis) or absent (D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni and D. grimshawi) sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Helena was present in the common ancestor of the Drosophila genus and has been vertically transmitted in derived lineages, but lost on some of them. Since a complete highly active copy was observed only in D. mojavensis, we studied in more detail its 5' end region. We used a reporter gene and verified the presence of internal promoter for Pol II that is associated with epigenetic histone modifications for permissive (H3K4me2) and  repressive  heterochromatin (H3K27me3). These \u201cbivalent marks\u201d indicate that Helena can be expressed in response to specific stimulus. A study of BS element, a TE closely related to Helena, showed that the evolutionary dynamics of both TEs are very similar. Bioinformatics analysis of the 12 Drosophila genomes revealed that BS is also widely variable in the species analyzed regarding to distribution, abundance, degree of degradation and also about their evolutionary cycle","Nowadays, LASER remains the tool the most effective and most used to inject faults within the modern secure microcontrollers. Among its main advantages we can quote its strong spatial and temporal resolutions. These advantages are however accessible only to the price of consequent investments in time and money with a cost oscillating between two and four hundreds of thousand euro according to the quality of the LASER. Besides these financial aspects, the publication by scientists, as well as the integration by the manufacturers of smart cards, effective countermeasures, as light detectors, incited to the development of alternative faults injection techniques with moderate costs. Among these alternative techniques, we find the electromagnetic fault injection techniques which allow perturbing the behavior of circuits. It is in this context that this thesis presents the main effects of this kind of fault injection by proceeding to a first decomposition in front side and back side, then in one second bound to the shape of the disturbing signal (harmonic or pulsed) used. So, we highlight coupling effects with metals lines but also a Forward effect on the target circuit.","Controlling the pot life and the gelation of epoxy resins is a crucial issue in thermosets processing. In this study, we report about the control of the gel time (tgel) and the gel conversion (xgel) for the cationic polymerization of commercial epoxy resins. To this end, hydroxyl additives are used as chain transfer agent to control xgel. Concurrently, oligo(ethylene oxide) additives are used to vary tgel as a result of the supramolecular complexation of the anilinium cations responsible for the polymerization\u2019s initiation.  We show that the combination of these two control levers enables the exploration of a wide range of tgel and xgel values. When a cyclic oligo(ethylene oxide) (18-crown-6) is used, anilinium cations are stabilized on very long period as a result of strong host-guest interactions. In absence of transfer agent, a slight increase of temperature is enough to observe the dissociation of the anilinium\u202218-crown-6 complex and the fast initiation of polymerization. The anilinium\u202218-crown-6 complex can be isolated and used as a thermoresponsive initiator presenting a high apparent activation energy. When used in combination with hydroxyl additives, a temperature increase results in a long delay of polymerization followed by the rapid completion of the material\u2019s reticulation. By varying the composition of the initial mixture it is possible to tailor the duration of the polymerization\u2019s delay. Thus, the resulting system is programmable and exhibits a clock like behavior. This chemistry is then extended to the copolymerization of diepoxy and monoepoxy resins to control the crosslink\u2019s density of the material and thus, the properties of the final networks.","Increasingly, fire safety relies on fire safety engineering. This involves, in particular, using calculation codes, performing numerical simulations aimed at defining the safety rules to be applied. Thus, numerous studies have made it possible to improve the calculation codes and define the bases and technical guides to be respected for carrying out these studies. However, while this is true in the field of fire resistance, evacuation or smoke control, it is not yet the case in the field of reaction to fire. The latter represents how the material will behave as a fuel and it characterizes the ability of that material to ignite and contribute to a fire.In this context, the objective of this thesis work is to study and predict the kinetics of thermal decomposition, combustion and flame propagation of wood material. For this, the working method adopted is multi-scale, both experimental and digital. This approach allows initially to simplify the phenomena in order to determine the properties of the material, then to add complexity on an increasing scale, in order to identify the processes controlling the propagation of flame and to define the bases for an engineering study. In total, 4 working scales were studied:- At a small scale, which concerns only the solid phase. It permits to extract some properties of the material by working on samples of the order of a milligram. The properties extracted are the thermal and kinetic properties, essential to characterize the heating and thermal decomposition of the material on a larger scale.- At medium scale, including the influence of the gas phase within particularly the development of the flame on the surface of the sample. The samples are of the order of a hundred grams with a thickness identical to the final application of the product. The objective is first to identify the combustion parameters of the material, such as the heat of combustion, the rate of formation of soot, carbon monoxide, etc. Secondly, it concerns the numerical validation of all the properties extracted (thermal, kinetic and combustion properties) by comparison with the experimental data (rate of heat release, loss of mass, temperatures, etc. ).- At the intermediate scale, using samples of the order of one kilogram. It takes into account the propagation of flame on the surface of the sample. Therefore, the processes driving this propagation are studied. This scale is used to assess the ability of the code to predict the kinetics of flame propagation. Two modes of propagation are investigated: counter-current and co-current. This scale also makes it possible to establish certain bases for carrying out a reaction to fire engineering study.- At final scale, two studied modes of propagation are coupled. The objective is then to validate the observations made at the previous scale and to support the basis for an engineering study.","Biological sequence alignment is a fundamental technique in bioinformatics, and consists of identifying series of similar (conserved) characters that appear in the same order in both sequences, and eventually deducing a set of modifications (substitutions, insertions and deletions) involved in the transformation of one sequence into the other. This technique allows one to infer, based on sequence similarity, if two or more biological sequences are potentially homologous, i.e. if they share a common ancestor, thus enabling the understanding of sequence evolution.This thesis addresses sequence comparison problems in two different contexts: homology detection and high throughput DNA sequencing. The goal of this work is to develop sensitive alignment methods that provide solutions to the following two problems: i) the detection of hidden protein homologies by protein sequence comparison, when the source of the divergence are frameshift mutations, and ii) mapping short SOLiD reads (sequences of overlapping di-nucleotides encoded as colors) to a reference genome. In both cases, the same general idea is applied: to implicitly compare DNA sequences for detecting changes occurring at this level, while manipulating, in practice, other representations (protein sequences, sequences of di-nucleotide codes) that provide additional information and thus help to improve the similarity search. The aim is to design and implement exact and heuristic alignment methods, along with scoring schemes, adapted to these scenarios.","Hypoxia, a major component of tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma (GB), is a poor prognostic factor influencing radiotherapy (RT). To alleviate hypoxia, two approaches were discussed in this thesis, both at the clinical and preclinical scales. Firstly, we have adapted a methodology to map tissue oxygen pressure (ptO2) from PET 18F-FMISO, for further adaptation of RT. Secondly, we have tested other methods for quantifying tumor hypoxia, at the preclinical scale, by using mpMRI and particularly oxygen saturation (StO2) in human GB models. Then, we have studied the effects of carbogen as mean to alleviate tumor hypoxia in two models differing in vascular and hypoxic status. These experiences has shown that the initial vascular tone is an important condition for optimal re-oxygenation of the tumor when the carbogen is considered. The mpMRI may be a relevant mean in GB patient\u2019s stratification in order to enhance the effects of radiotherapy. This point was also investigated in this thesis. We have shown that the models which are more responsive to carbogen reveals a higher level of radiosensitivity. As a whole, in this work, we present data showing the importance of multimodal and multiparametric imaging to assess and to target hypoxia in GB. In conclusion, in this work, we have shown the interest of the multimodal imaging to reach various sides to counter the effects of hypoxia in glioblastomas.","The climatic system of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan is governed by the intense production of organic aerosols in its upper atmosphere. This phenomenon also certainly happened on Earth at the beginning of life. These two points strongly motivate research on the formation and evolution processes of the aerosols in the atmosphere of Titan. The aerosols form and stay several weeks in the ionosphere, between ~900-1200 km of altitude. This atmospheric layer is ionized by UV solar rays and energetic particles coming from Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere, forming a plasma with very reactive species: radicals, excited species, ions and electrons. In such an environment, the main question I tackle is how the organic aerosols interact with the plasma species.The phenomenon is simulated in the laboratory with a plasma setup developed on purpose: analogues of Titan aerosols are exposed to a N2-H2 plasma discharge. Both an evolution of the solid and the gas phase are observed. H and N atoms chemically interact with the aerosols. Then, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and other organic molecules are ejected in the gas phase by ion sputtering. These results highlight an important contribution of heterogeneous processes in Titan\u2019s upper atmosphere.My re-analysis of the Cassini Langmuir probe data revealed the presence of an unexpected electron population in the ionosphere, below 1200 km and on the day-side, where heavy ions are also detected. These electrons could be emitted by the aerosols, after collision with a photon, and\u002for heating by the active ion chemistry.","Microalgae supplies virtually all the oceanic trophic chains and participate in almost half of photosynthesis on Earth. Although their genetic diversity is well known, their functional diversity remains little explored. The main route of photosynthesis, the linear flux of electrons from water to CO2, seems to be well conserved among phylogeny. It involves two photosystems working in series, the photosystem II (PSII) and I (PSI). In plants and green algae, there is a cyclic electron flow that involves only the PSI which would be crucial for photosynthetic regulation. The study of this cyclic electron flow is hampered by the absence of robust method to measure it. We have shown that the most used method for estimating PSI activity is unreliable. On this basis, we propose an alternative method to detect the presence of cyclic electron flow and to study its dependence on the linear flux. We could show very different behaviors between species of microalgae. Finally, the study of an efflorescence of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi in mesocosm allowed us to highlight a signature of the cells infection by a virus which could involve the cyclic electron flow around the PSI.","The main objective of this thesis focuses on theoretical and algorithmic researches of local and global optimization techniques to DC programming & DCA with Branch and Bound (B&B) and the DC\u002fSDP relaxation techniques to solve several types of non-convex optimization problems (including Combinatorial Optimization and Polynomial Optimization). This thesis is divided into four parts :We present in the first part some fondamental theorems and essential techniques in DC programming & DC Algorithm (DCA), the SDP Relaxation techniques, as well as the Branch and Bound methods (B&B).In the second part, we are interested in solving mixed integer quadratic and linear programs. We propose new local and global approaches based on DCA, B&B and SDP. The implementation of software and numerical simulations have also been investigated.The third part explores the DC programming approaches & DCA combined with a B&B technique and SDP for locally and globally solving a class of polynomial programming. The polynomial program with homogeneous polynomial functionsand its application to portfolio selection problem involving higher order moments in financial optimization have been deeply studied in this part.Finally, in the last part, we present our research on optimization problems under constraints of semi-definite matrices via our DC programming approaches. This part is dedicated to the resolution of the BMI and QMI feasibility problems in the field of optimal control.All these proposed methods have been implemented with MATLAB, C++ etc., that allowing us to confirm the practical use and enrich our research works.","We aimed to investigate whether dietary n-3 PUFA, in Prim\u2018Holstein dairy cattle in lactation, could influence reproductive performance in terms of embryo production. We showed that n-3 PUFA-enriched diet had a tendency to increase the average number of oocyte-cumulus complexes recovered per cow per OPU session. A tendency to increase the average numbers per cow per OPU session of blastocysts and expanded blastocysts with significantly increase of blastocysts of quality 1 and 2 were noted in the n-3 group compared to the n-6 group. Similarly, the rate of blastocysts, expanded blastocysts and blastocysts of quality 1 and 2 were significantly increased in the n-3 group compared to the n-6 group. We also showed that the addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) at low concentration (1\u03bcM) during IVM of bovine oocytes increased cleavage rate, blastocyst rate and embryo quality. DHA and free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) agonist TUG- 891 (1 or 5 \u03bcM) supplied during IVM similarly improved in vitro embryo development, suggesting that FFAR4 may, at least partially, mediate DHA beneficial effects on OCC, through activation of signaling pathways.","Shrinking the physical dimensions of the Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) on Si-bulk technology leads to serious issues and silicon CMOS is now facing a dead-end. In order to follow the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) several technological solutions are visioned, like the use of alternative high-mobility materials including germanium (Ge). The germanium-on-insulator structure is expected to combine the enhanced electrostatic control in SOI devices with the advantageous transport properties of Ge. This study proposes a review of GeOI substrates and devices (pMOSFET) following three main directions. Firstly, the properties of GeOI substrates are investigated through pMOSFET characterizations and TCAD simulations. The second and third parts deal with the properties advanced pMOSFETs on GeOI with TiN\u002fHfO2 gate stack. The experiments show an undesired current leakage and an improved carrier effective mobility. This last point enables an in-depth comprehension of transport limiting mechanisms in GeOI pMOSFETs","Sound absorbing materials such as foams are widelyused in many industrial and domestic applications toabsorb undesirable sound. One needs to perform many calculations to get desirable properties of thetreatment using optimization strategies.The state-of-the-art computational models requireprohibitively high computational time. Theproblematic of this PhD is to reduce thecomputational time for such models to speed updesign calculations.This document is a synthesis of the work carried outin this direction. The problem is addressed usingDomain Decompostion methods (DDM). It consists ofsplitting the original problem into small parts referredto as subdomains. A partial solution is computed onthese subdomains to match the global continuity inthe domain of interest. Different DDM methods are benchmarked in termsof performance and scalability , specific for porousmaterials. Any DDM consists of two major costs, thefactorization of the subdomains and iterative part forthe global convergence. A novel factorizationstrategy is implemented and applied in 2D and 3Dto demonstrate savings in time compared toconventional approaches. In the second part, themethod is further improved to reduce the iterativecosts for a series of calculations.A final workflow is proposed to make thecomputationa cost of these models afforable withinindustrial timeframes.","The four main steps of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) lytic infection are (i) specific recognition and genome entry into the host bacterium, (ii) replication of the viral genome, (iii) assembly of viral particles, and (iv) their release, leading in most cases to cell lysis. Although the course of individual steps of the viral infection cycle has been relatively well established, the details of how viral DNA transits from the virion to the host cytoplasm and of how the cellular environment catalyzes and possibly organizes the entire process remain poorly understood.Tailed bacteriophages are by far the most abundant viruses that infect Eubacteria. The first event in their infection is recognition of a receptor on the surface of host bacterium by the phage adsorption machinery. The barriers that the infectious particle overcomes subsequently are the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. This implies a localized degradation of the wall and the flow of its double stranded DNA (dsDNA) through a hydrophilic pore in the membrane. The lineards DNA molecule is most frequently circularized in the cytoplasm followed by its replication. In this study we used bacteriophage SPP1 that infects the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis as a model system to dissect the different steps leading to transfer of the phage genome from the viral capsid to the host cell cytoplasm.normally to B. subtilis but do not trigger depolarization of the CM. Attachment of intact SPP1 particles is thus required for phage-induced depolarization.The beginning of B. subtilis infection by bacteriophage SPP1 was followed inspace and time. The position of SPP1 binding at the cell surface was imaged by fluorescence microscopy using virus particles labeled with \"quantum dots\". We found that SPP1 reversible adsorption occurs preferentially at the cell poles. This initial binding facilitates irreversible adsorption to the SPP1 phage receptor protein YueB,which is encoded by a putative type VII secretion system gene cluster.Immunostaining and YueB \u2013 GFP fusion showed that the phage receptor protein YueB is found over the entire cell surface. It concentrates at the bacterial poles too,and displays a punctate distribution over the sidewalls. The dynamics of SPP1 DNA entry and replication was visualised in real time by assaying specific binding of a fluorescent protein to tandem sequences present in the SPP1 genome. During infection, most of the infecting phages DNA entered and replicated near the bacterial poles in a defined focus. Therefore, SPP1 assembles a replication factory at a specific location in the host cell cytoplasm. DNA delivery to the cytoplasm depends on millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ allowing uncoupling it from the precedent steps of SPP1 adsorption to the cell envelope and CM depolarization that require only micromolar amounts of this divalent cation. A model describing the early events of bacteriophage SPP1 infection is presented.","The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a pollinator playing a major economic and ecological role. The losses of honeybee colonies observed in the recent decades reflect a more general decline of pollinators. The origin of this decline is believed to be multicausal, implying many stressors able to interact each other. This work focuses on the impact of two stressors frequently found in the honeybee, the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides (active ingredients or phytopharmaceutical formulations), as well as their interactions. A synergistic effect on bee mortality has been observed with certain combinations. N. ceranae and the insecticides also induced a modulation of enzymatic activities and in the honeybee midgut transcriptome, with genes involved in immunity, detoxification, epithelial and neuronal integrity and cell cycle. The Nosema-insecticide combination specifically induced a modulation of genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, a disturbance of the major bacterial species of the intestinal microbiota has been observed in response to these stressors. This work demonstrated interactions between insecticide formulations and between a parasite and two insecticides, and proposes hypotheses on the mode of action of these interactions which remain to be verified at the individual and colony scales.","This thesis deals with kernel estimates of the hazard function (denoted by \u03bb) in the case when the variables are censored. It composed of three chapters. In each of the first two chapters, we construct a kernel estimator by using a double recursive stochastic algorithm (two-time-scale stochastic algorithm), and then establish its convergence in law. We compare these estimates with a nonrecursive kernel estimator. We show that the asymptotic rate of the recursive estimator \u03bbn and the one of the nonrecursive version are similar. However, in terms of confidence interval estimation, we show that it is better to use the estimator \u03bbn rather than the nonrecursive version: for the same asymptotic level, the width of the interval obtained by the recursive estimator is smaller than the one obtained with the nonrecursive version. In the third chapter, we first recall the notions of large deviations and moderate deviations, then we establish the pointwise and uniform moderate deviations principles for the sequence (e\u03bb\u0303n-\u03bb) where e\u03bb\u0303n is a nonrecursive estimator.","F508del, the most frequent mutation found in cystic fibrosis (CF) population, impacts CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) trafficking and causes its rapid degradation at the endoplasmic compartment, resulting in a significant decrease in Cl- secretion at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. F508del has two main features, significant thickening of the bronchial mucus and a reduction in the integrity of the luminal barrier of the bronchial epithelium. These two phenomena are involved in the invasion and infection of lung tissue by pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exacerbating the inflammation and lung destruction. The objective of this study was to determine the role of two proteins member of the heterotrimeric G proteins family, G\uf06112 and G\uf06113, in the degradation of the F508del CFTR, and in the control of junctional complexes in the normal and CF bronchial epithelium. Our results show for the first time that G\uf06112 and G\uf06113 are down expressed in CF. G\uf06112, but not G\uf06113, is involved in the control of F508del-CFTR degradation through its interaction with Calnexin and HSP90 chaperones. Unlike kidney epithelia cells, G\uf06112 promotes the formation and maintenance of cell junctions in the bronchial epithelium by affecting E-cadherine and ZO-1 stability. Altogether, our results set therefore G\uf06112 as a significant actor of the CF disease.","A major issue concerning the remediation of industrial plants is the characterization of contamination within soils and groundwater. Two classical approaches are combined in this work: geostatistics and numerical simulations of flow and transport. It aims at improving the estimates of radionuclide activities by taking into account physically-based information into a mathematical model. Two methods are introduced in this work. They are both based on a large number of simulations of contaminant plumes, taking into account the uncertainties on input parameters. The first method is kriging with an external drift, in which the drift is the average of the simulations. The second method is kriging with a non-stationary empirical variogram computed from the set of simulations, which models the spatial structure of the phenomenon under study. The performances of the methods are first assessed on a synthetic test case, which deals with the migration of a tritium plume in the unsaturated zone of a sandy aquifer. Then, they are assessed on two datasets collected around Chernobyl nuclear plant. The results underline the benefit of combining geostatistics and numerical simulations, especially when only few observations are available.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children. There is no vaccine nor antiviral for humans. This virus encodes its own NA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to transcribe and replicate viral genes. The RdRp is composed of the nucleoprotein N, the phosphoprotein P, the large protein L and the transcription factor M2-1. Our aim is to characterize the structure and the function of the RdRp proteins to develop antiviral strategies. The M2-1 protein functions as an essential transcriptional cofactor of the RdRp complex by increasing polymerase processivity. M2-1 is a modular RNA binding protein that also interacts with the viral phosphoprotein P, another component of the RdRp complex. These binding properties are related to the core region of M2-1 encompassing residues S58 to K177. Here we report the NMR structure of the RSV M2-158-177 core domain. The partial overlap of RNA and P interaction surfaces on M2-158-177 rationalizes the previously observed competitive behavior of RNA versus P. We identified eight residues located on these surfaces that are critical for an efficient transcription activity of the RdRp complex. Single bodies, which are regarded as sites of viral RNA synthesis, was impared by mutations affecting only binding to P, but not to RNA, suggesting that M2-1 is associated to the hononucleocapsid by interacting with P. These results reveal that RNA and P binding to M2- can be uncoupled and that both are critical for the transcriptional activation function of M2-1.","This thesis deals with adapting the level of consistency during solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). It focuses on the use of local consistency properties stronger than arc consistency (AC) to improve the CSP solving efficiency. Local consistency properties stronger than arc consistency are generally expensive to maintain in a constraint network. Therefore, these local consistencies are seldom used in practice. This thesis gives several contributions to benefit from the filtering power of local consistencies stronger than AC while avoiding the high cost of maintaining them in the whole constraint network and throughout the search. First, we introduce the parameterized local consistency (p-LC), an original approach that allows us to define intermediate levels of consistency between AC and a local consistency LC stronger than AC. Then, we present the instantiation of the parameterized local consistency approach to maxRPC and SAC, two consistencies stronger than AC. This leads to two parameterized consistencies, namely p-maxRPC and p-SAC. After giving the definitions of p-maxRPC and p-SAC, we present the algorithm p-maxRPC3, that achieves p-maxRPC and the algorithm p-SAC1, for achieving p-SAC in a constraint network. We show experimentally that maintaining an intermediate level of consistency p-LC, can give a good compromise between filtering power and the computational cost of maintaining this level of consistency. We also show that for each instance of CSP we can find a parameter that gives this good compromise. The parameterized local consistency approach does not specify how the parameter can be chosen a priori. Hence, we propose two techniques to automatically adjust the parameter p. In fact, both techniques don't use a single parameter, but several parameters. Each parameter is mapped to a part of the problem and it is automatically and locally adjusted during search. Finally, we propose POAC1, the first algorithm achieving partition-one-AC (POAC) in a constraint network. We compare POAC to SAC and we found that POAC converges faster than SAC to the fixed point due to its ability to prune values from all variable domains when being enforced on a given variable. Based on this observation, we proposed APOAC, an adaptive version of POAC, that monitors the number of variables on which to enforce POAC.","In France, the waste wood deposit product in companies of first and second transformation is estimated at about twelve million tons per year. 60\\% of this waste comes mainly from mills in the form of sawdust and wood chips. There are many methods of recovery of such waste, which in turn causes environmental problems through the use of products harmful to the environment. A new challenge is to find ways and means to sustainable and consistent recovery of such waste. A new challenge is to find ways and means to sustainable and consistent recovery of such waste. The recovery of such waste in construction materials could be a sustainable solution. In this context, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Council initiated a project for the recovery of such wastes by developing new building materials from wood byproducts. This thesis has been intended to develop biocomposites based on cement paste and sawdust resulting from Poplar species. These biocomposites are designed for be used as part-bearing masonry and are subject to mechanical strength criteria set by the French standard. The study of the influence of sawdust on the mechanical, rheological and physico-chemical of a mortar was performed by replacing the sand by sawdust at rates ranging from 10 to 100 \\%. The results obtained showed a loss of mechanical strength with increasing volume of wood in the mixture generated by chemical phenomena. However the compressive strength obtained for significant substitution rate (50 to 60\\%) were in accordance with the French standard. These results led to the optimization of a wood mortar formulation met can be extruded using a ram extruder. In order to apply the development of these biocomposites in an industrial scale, the sawdust was introduced into a formulation of micro-concrete used in the production of industrial concrete blocks manufactured by vibro-compaction. The results showed that up to 50\\% of substitution of sand by the sawdust, the mechanical properties were compliant. The thermal characterization of the blocks showed an interesting insulation capacity.","Melanoma is the leading cause of death from skin cancer. However if it is detected early, it can be treated by simple excision and the prognosis is excellent. Clinical diagnosis is based on various morphological features of the skin lesion but little is known about the mechanisms responsible for generating the shapes and microstructures typical of melanoma. The aim of this work is to explore the morphogenetic processes involved during the development of melanocytic lesions using the tools of macroscopic physics. We first derive a multiphase model in a lubrication limit to describe the radial growth phase of melanoma in the epidermis. We prove analytically and numerically the occurrence of a contour instability leading to the apparition of undulations that we compare to the irregular border often observed in melanoma. The analytical results correlate the microscopic properties of the tumor to its macroscopic shape and evolution. We then demonstrate the possibility of a spinodal decomposition in the class of multiphase model considered and leading to cell aggregation. We show how the behavior of the aggregates is perturbed at long time by the mechanisms regulating cell proliferation and find the existence of a steady state where tumor cells are organized symmetrically, in dots, in lines or in a grid-pattern. These results explain the presence of dots and globules in pigmented lesion, uniform in size, shape and distribution in benign lesions and more irregular in melanoma. Focusing finally on glabrous skin, we investigate how the particular geometry of the epidermis in these regions influences the appearance of pigmented lesions. By modeling melanin transport we present a mechanism explaining the apparition of a parallel pattern and the localization of melanin columns. To investigate how geometry influence the repartition of tumor cells we derive a multiphase model describing growth in a thin curved layer, showing how cell aggregates are found in epidermal ridges","Global energy consumption, which is gradually increasing, has led to the search for alternative renewable resources. Europe has put the development of the biogas sector as a priority to enhance organic matter and produce sustainable energy and clean fuel. Several technologies have been developed to produce bio-methane and then to liquefy it. Cryo Pur developed a cryogenic process where the biogas is cooled gradually to 3 temperature levels: -40 \u00b0 C; -75 \u00b0 C and -120 \u00b0C. In a first step, the steam is extracted at -40 \u00b0C and at -75 \u00b0 C, the dry biogas contains 65 % methane and 35 % CO2. The biogas is then cooled to -120 \u00b0C in a low-temperature refrigeration system to capture carbon dioxide and obtain bio-methane with 2.5 % of CO2. Once this bio-methane is obtained, it is liquefied at a pressure of 15 bara and a temperature of -120 \u00b0C. An energy and exergy study is studied and takes as reference the pilot of purification and liquefaction Cryo Pur installed at the exit of digester of the purification station of Valenton. CO2 is captured by frosting on the fins of heat exchangers. The defrosting is carried out by a two-phase flow rate taken from the -40 \u00b0C stage of the low-temperature refrigeration system. The thesis compares the energy recovered by a liquid CO2 defrosted with a rise in temperature up to -56 \u00b0C (triple point temperature of CO2) and defrosting by sublimation of CO2 at a temperature much lower than - 56 \u00b0 C which is the subject of an energy optimization. The thesis also conducts an energy and exergy study of the complete process of biogas and bio-methane liquefaction with the recovery of energy by sublimation of carbon dioxide.A test bench is designed to evaluate the energy performance of the CO2 defrosting process by sublimation. The various necessary elements of this test bench are presented with their energy consumption. In this test bench, the defrosting of the carbon dioxide by sublimation is carried out via a low-temperature heat-transfer fluid which recovers the energy sublimation of the CO2 reducing the power consumed by the low-temperature refrigeration system. This new process requires a vacuum pump. The consumption of this vacuum pump depends on the sublimation pressure and is the subject of an energy optimization study. The density of CO2 varies enormously depending on the temperature and the sublimation pressure. A model of the evolution of the thickness of the frost during the sublimation is presented. As a conclusion of this section, a comparison is made between the specific power consumption of the system installed at Valenton and that of the test bench.On the other hand, the duration of the frosting cycle also requires an energy optimization study associated with the design of the exchanger that capture the CO2. The tube-fins exchanger with the shape of the fin and the parameters affecting the CO2 frosting are presented. A study is carried out to uniformly distribution of the CO2 mass on the exchange surface to reduce the blocking rate of the exchanger and to extend the duration of the frosting phase. A study on the effect of biogas velocity and temperature slippage of the refrigerant over the cycle is carried out as well as a study on the materials of the fins and tubes selected in order to minimize the exchange surface and have the bio-methane with 2 % CO2.","Although it is well admitted that the glutamatergic neurotransmission plays a pivotal role in the development and expression of behavioral sensitization to amphetamine, the specific role of glutamatergic structures that project to the ventral tegmental and\u002for the nucleus accumbens is less well studied. We showed that the dorsal hippocampus, the prelimbic part of the prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala play a critical role in both acute (development of sensitization) and chronic (expression of sensitization) locomotor responses induced by amphetamine, suggesting that behavioral responses to amphetamine are mediated by circuitry of corticolimbic glutamatergic structures. Next, we investigated the role of glutamatergic NMDA receptors contained in the nucleus accumbens, which is seen as the key structure for the expression of sensitization, in the development of short term sensitization to amphetamine. Interestingly, we showed that, contrasting with the current dichotomous thinking that has attributed specialized functions to the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, respectively in the development and the expression of behavioral sensitization, concomitant activation of certain types of NMDA and nicotinic receptors in the nucleus accumbens is also required for the development of short term sensitization. Furthermore, we showed that concomitant activation of these receptors sustained the amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. All these data show that glutamatergic neurotransmission, and glutamatergic structures which project onto m\u00e9soaccumbens system, plays a major role in short-term behavioral sensitization to amphetamine.","The concept of network provides a model for representing a wide variety of objects and systems, both natural and social, in which a set of homogeneous or heterogeneous entities interact. It is now widely used to describe various kinds of relational structures. However, if everyone has an idea of the concept of network, we often ignore the implications that these structures have in real world phenomena. This is for example the case of processes such as the spread of a rumor, the disease transmission, or even the emergence of subjects of common interest for a group of individuals, in which the relations maintained between individuals, and their nature, often prove to be the main factors determining the evolution of the phenomenon. This is the reason why the study of networks has become one of the emerging areas in the 21st century called the \"Science of networks.\" ln this thesis, we address three issues of the domain of the science of networks: the problem of diffusion in social networks, where we have addressed more particularly the impact of the network dynamics on the diffusion process, the problem of the analysis of social networks, in which we have proposed a solution to take full advantage of all information available on the network by combining information on both structure and node attributes and the central problem of the social data collection, for which we have focused on the particular case of the data collection in a wild environment.","The thesis is devoted to an extension of the existing continuous wave high frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-HF-EPR) spectrometer in order to work in a pulsed mode. The thesis is split into two parts. Whereas the first part is devoted to our attempt to develop a pulsed HF-EPR spectrometer which operates close to 285 GHz, the second experimental part illustrates the application of the technical developments presented in the first part to the study of single molecule magnets (SMMs) and of single layers of graphite (graphene). In the development part, a detailed description of the HF-EPR spectrometer is given together with the basis of Quasi-Optical propagation. This theoretical summary is then applied to the existing quasi-optical bridge for the propagation of microwave (MW) and to the building up of a Fabry-P\u00e9rot resonator. The EPR signal is recorded by a superheterodyne detector optimised for a 283. 2 GHz frequency, which was implemented during this work and replaces a slow bolometeric detection suitable only for multi-frequency cw-HF-EPR. The design and construction of a Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FP) resonator, necessary to enhance the MW excitation power, are also described in detail together with a newly developed rotating holder for single crystal studies. These two new devices were then successfully applied in the experimental part of the thesis (two chapters). First, a complete study of tetrairon(III) Single-Molecule Magnets was performed. After a powder study, a single crystal study performed with the rotating sample holder allowed obtaining refined parameters for the magnetic anisotropy, which are necessary for a deeper understanding of the relaxation processes. The second experimental chapter is devoted to graphene (2D crystal). In this chapter, the high performance of the Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity led to the observation of outstanding quality of graphene expressed by a charge carrier mobility exceeding 10^7 cm^2\u002f(V. S).","The subject of this thesis lies in the context of organic electronic based on conjugated polymers. We have chosen the class of polyfluorene mainly because of their blue emission, good quantum efficiency and possibility of modifying their properties by grafting side chain groups. The originality of our research relies upon the use of a particular devices structure. The structure of our electroluminescent films is based on the use of a thin layer of carbon nanotubes added to the structure of the emissive layer without involving any chemical modification.The work done in this thesis has mainly consisted of deposing polymer films with thicknesses and doping level controlled on the surface of carbon nanotubes by optimizing various parameters of the electrochemical synthesis. Functional groups have also been grafted on the side of chains in order to improve the performances of the polymer and to increase the compatibility between the polymer layer and the carbon nanotube dispersion. The use of carbon nanotubes should improve the charge carriers whitout quenching the photophysical properties of the polymers.","Superhydrophobic surface is characterized by an apparent contact angle higher than 150\u00b0 and a low dynamic contact angle. This phenomenon, found in nature, arouses great attention from the scientific community. Indeed, controlling the wettability of a solid surface is important in many applications. Many techniques to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces have been described, including the electrochemical polymerization which allows to obtain surfaces with various wettability by a controlled way and using conductive polymers. The development of materials with switchable wettability, sensitive to external stimuli is of great interest for their potential applications. The aim of this thesis is the development of reversible superhydrophobic materials by using conducting polymers. We obtained superhydrophobic surfaces by using hydrophilic ammonium monomers. Changes in wettability were obtained by dedoping and ion exchange. Reversible hydrophobic \u002f hydrophilic properties were achieved by surface post-functionnalization using differents boronic acids.","The overall objective was to assess the genetic diversity of a collection of native potato varieties originating from the island of Chiloe, to characterize the resistance of these varieties to late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and to inquire about the status of in-situ conservation.  The following specific topics was developed: a) conservation in-situ of native Solanum within the great isle of Chiloe and its impact on diversity, b) evaluation of the morphological diversity of the native potatoes that we have collected c) assessment of genetic diversity of the collection by the mean of microsatellite and AFLP markers, d) characterization of field and in-vitro resistances to late blight. Based on the results of the surveys, we can conclude that in-situ maintenance of native potato diversity i is not well preserved, due to strong social and economic changes on the island of Chiloe. There is a clear process of replacing native varieties for commercial cultivars in response to market conditions.  Native varieties are present in 80.5% of the farms of Chiloe, but the diversity of varieties has been significantly reduced. The results morphological diversity showed the formation of groups under the popular name and local attributes assigned by the farmers themselves. Molecular evaluation of the collection (SSRs and AFLP) reveals a high degree of genetic diversity. Both markers were consistent in classifying Solanum fernandezianum as the more distant genotype compared to all the others. The SSRs allowed the estimation of the polymorphic information content for seven loci which values ranged between 0.63 to 0.89. Both types of markers, did not provide the same groupings among the accessions.  The SSR-based study showed a low differentiation between native potatoes and improved cultivated varieties. The analysis of diversity based on the AFLP was not inconsistent with this result because despite containing only one cultivar (Desiree), the cultivar was grouped with the native varieties. In relation to resistance to late blight, most accessions of native potato fall into the ranks moderately resistant to moderately susceptible.","Monitoring the underwater environment requires the deployment of dedicated sensors and infrastructure whose cost and impact on flora and fauna must be reduced. The target application aims geographic areas of less than 1km2 in which transmissions of video streams and measurements, taken by submerged sensors, must be carried out wirelessly over distances greater than 10m with a minimum bit rate of 80kbps for powers of emission around a dozen of Watts. A comparative study of acoustic, optical and electromagnetic communication methods in seawater is presented. This analysis is introduced by defining a set of performance criteria intended to assess and select the technique best suited to application needs. The electromagnetic methods, whose deployment costs and environmental impact are minimal, however presents limitations of ranges for the desired data rate. The remainder of this thesis presents the research work that has been carried out to remove these technological obstacles. A first simplified model of propagation of electromagnetic fields in an underwater environment has been developed to differentiate the propagation modes favouring conduction losses from those caused by the dielectric properties of sea water. Prototype antennas have been developed to try to excite the medium by favouring one or the other mode. Finally, the detailed study of a magneto-inductive coupling model made it possible to carry out and evaluate the performance of such a link using original bandwidth widening techniques which were implemented successfully in an underwater MODEM prototype.","The thesis is in the framework of developments made at CEA LIST of a module of the CIVA platform to simulate nondestructive testing (NDT) by ultrasonic guided waves; it is dedicated to the development and the validation of models simulating the examination of pipelines and is focussed on the case of pipeline comprising one or several elbows. To predict effects due to the curvature on guided waves, an extension in curvilinear coordinates of the semi-analytic finite element method is worked out to compute modes propagating in an elbow, by solving an eigen system restricted to the guide section. This development allows us to better understand effects due to the curvature such as displacement field distortions or cut-off frequencies splits. The scattering of waves at the junction between a straight tube and an elbow is then computed by means of the mode-matching method, leading to the modal scattering matrix of the junction; matrix elements are obtained by numerical evaluation of integrals over the junction surface. Local scattering matrices are finally combined to propagation matrices to account for the presence of several scatterers in the pipeline, to form a global scattering matrix. Its minimal computation cost allows us to study the influence of the parameters of the testing configuration and to optimize them. Models are validated by comparing their predictions to numerical and experimental results of the literature and to measurements made at CETIM on industrial mock-ups. Integrated in the platform CIVA, the developed models extend the capabilities of the guided wave NDT module.","Climate change is leading to long-term changes in global temperature and precipitation, but also to more frequent and intense extreme weather events. While the responses of ectotherms to thermal conditions have attracted considerable interest, physiological and behavioral responses to water constraints are seldomly considered. Yet, understanding the ecological responses to climate change requires the consideration of the combined effects of thermal and water stressors and clarification of the interactions between thermoregulation and hydroregulation. The general hypothesis of my thesis is that the physiological and behavioral mechanisms of thermal and water balance regulation are closely linked. Through experimental approaches, I have documented the physiological and behavioral responses to climatic constraints of two terrestrial ectotherms, the European adder (Vipera berus) and the asp viper (Vipera aspis), over time scales ranging from weeks to several years, both during and outside of reproduction. My results demonstrate that thermal and water balance regulations interact and incorporate shared proximal mechanisms. I found that there were predominantly additive effects of combined thermal and water constraints on physiology, and pronounced sensitivity to water constraints during reproduction in these viviparous ectotherms. I also demonstrated that individuals exhibit behavioral hydroregulation in response to dehydration: organisms can mitigate the effects of water stress on physiology by limiting their exposure through the selection of moist microclimates or, if avoidance is impossible, restore their water balance after stress exposure. Altogether, my work illustrates the importance of considering the effects of water constraints on ectotherms, and their ability to respond through physiological and behavioral adjustments, in order to better understand and predict the responses of terrestrial ectotherms to climate change.","Green chemistry is today a priority axis of research and industry. The use of biobased compounds, safe solvents and economic processes is at the heart of this sustainable chemistry. In particular, many polyhydroxy compounds can be obtained by treatment of the biomass and use in this chemistry. The telomerization of butadiene catalysed by palladium on alcohol or polyol results in the formation of ethers with octadienyl chain. The reaction allows 100% atom economy which is in agreement with the previous concepts of sustainable chemistry. Our study relates the selective synthesis of mono-, di-, tri- or tetratelomers obtained by telomerization of butadiene on biosourced polyols. Optimization of the reaction was first carried out on the glycerol and then transposed on other biosourced polyols such as erythritol, pentaerythritol, methylglucose or sorbitol in order to obtain telomeres which ultimately have two functions. The kinetic studies of the telomerization reaction were also conducted under constant flow of butadiene to include this system in a continuous process. The installation of this system, from the production of biobutadiene from ethanol to its use in the telomerization reaction was carried out. Finally, the synthesized diols have been used in polycondensation reactions with diacids in order to produce alkyd resins present in the paint composition.","In 2014, American and Chinese studies have identified the influenza D virus (IDV). This new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family shares only 50% sequence identity with the already well characterized influenza C virus and less than 30% sequence identity with influenza A and B viruses. IDV has been detected in pigs and cattle, and has been shown to replicate in the ferret, the main animal model for influenza virus studies in humans, suggesting a possible transmission. In 2018, a new study identified the first influenza viruses infecting cold-blooded animals. A phylogenetic comparison highlighted that these viruses, and more particularly a toad-infecting virus (ToadV), were closer to influenza B viruses than influenza A viruses. This relationship is surprising, taking into account the influenza B restricted host spectrum in comparison to the influenza A one.After the work on influenza A and B viruses and in line with it, the team collaborates now with Mariette Ducatez (INRA - ENV Toulouse) to detail the IDV replication, but also the replication machinery of ToadV. The replication machinery comprises various proteins, including the RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the nucleoprotein (NP). The RdRp is composed of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2), binds both the highly conserved 3\u2019- and 5\u2019-ends of the vRNA segment which is covered by multiple copies of NP. This macromolecular complex replicates the viral genome in the nucleus of infected cells and makes many contacts with cellular partners for its assembly. We have gained evidences that IDV NP uses the importins-\u03b1 system, similar to influenza A and B nucleoproteins. By using advanced techniques of modern biology and physics (X-ray, electron microscopy, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence anisotropy, ...), the aims of this project are 1\u002f to provide structural and functional data on IDV and ToadV nucleoproteins and also on their interactions with host partners, and 2\u002f to highlight both the common and specific features of all types of influenza NPs, giving precious insights on the evolution processes occurring within this growing family of viruses.","Guided Mode Resonance Filters ( GMRF ) are a new generation of narrowband optical filters and are a very promising alternative to conventional multilayer Fabry-Perot filters. The resonance peak of GMRF can be spectrally extremely thin and with a centering wavelength tunable according to the angle of incidence of the light. These properties are particularly important for spectroscopy. Previous works have helped to implement an original structure with two 1D crossed gratings. The performance of this filter overpasses those of conventional filters in their spectral subnanometric response, tunability and their ability to overcome the influence of the polarization of the incident wave under oblique incidence. The aim of this work is to explore the final performances of such devices in terms of resolution and rejection rate, thanks to an approach combining theory, fabrication technology and characterization. We present experimental results of a polarization independent reflective filter, tunable over 40nm with a tunability of 8.3nm \u002f \u00b0, having a reflection of 10-3 on a 90nm range outside the resonance and a quality factor over 5000.","Skin is daily exposed to sun radiation. Among them, UVA reach the basal layer of epidermis composed of keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) and progenitors commonly called transitory amplifying cells (TA). KSC and TA, responsible of the epidermal renewal, are sensitive to genotoxic agents and more particularly to UV. Indeed, KSC, usually quiescent but composing the stem cell pool all lifelong, as well as TA, are specific targets for photocarcinogenesis and photoageing. In this context, the aim of the project was to develop a method able to isolate KSC and TA for characterizing their response to UVA, and in a more industrial objective, to value a photoprotective and\u002for genoprotective ingredient by investigating their mechanisms of action. A parallel aim was to define culture conditions suitable for maintaining the stemness of KSC in culture, which is quickly lost from their enter into a proliferative state. Thus we showed that adjunction of adipose derived stem cells (ASC) to fibroblasts in dermis of a skin equivalent model (SE) in order to reproduce the physiological environment of KSC, significantly increases the thickness of the epidermis and preserves the keratinocytes from their senescence. ASC act partially via the increase of fibroblasts proliferation in dermis and potentially via a synergic effect of factors secreted by the combination of ASC and fibroblasts. To compare the behavior of KSC to the one of TA, we firstly optimized the rapid adhesion method ; then compared it to the cell sorting by flow cytometry following the alpha6high\u002fCD71low phenotype, which appeared more efficient. Thus, KSC (alpha6high\u002fCD71low) and TA (alpha6high\u002fCD71high) were then irradiated to UVA. KSC showed a photoresistance compared to TA with a better cell viability and a clonogenic potential superior as well as a better ability to reconstruct a pluristratified epidermis in vitro. We also investigated mechanisms of resistance. Our results demonstrate that the induction of the three types of DNA damage immediately induced by UVA is similar in both populations, but that the repair of single strand breaks (SSB) and of thymin dimers (CPDs) is faster for KSC. Finally, PE1, ingredient preselected by Gattefoss\u00e9 was characterized for its photoprotective and genoprotective effect. We showed that PE1 is able to i) preserve capacity of keratinocytes to form holoclones after UVA radiation, ii) decrease DNA damage, notably 8oxoGuanin and CPDs, and iii) improve several repair genes expression and activities. To conclude, this thesis project showed for the first time that KSC are more resistant to UVA radiation than their direct progeny, TA notably via improved DNA repair systems. Moreover, it allowed to identify a plant extract (PE1) able to protect genome of proliferative keratinocytes to UVA radiation","Currently in Guadeloupe, there is 5,92 % of the electric power request covered by the photovoltaic sector  and 3,14 % by the wind sector which represents 9,06 % for their accumulated production, according to the OREC report (Regional Monitoring center of  Energy and Climate).  According to the regional energy plan, the accumulated production of the photovoltaic and the wind energy should represent 14 % of the electric mix in 2020 and 18 % in 2030. To reach the 14 % of the electric mix within the next five years, we need, among other things, to improve forecast for a sustained development of these energies. These research works consisted in bringing new performance results of short-term forecast of the global solar radiation and in giving a finer knowledge of the resource onto three stations in Guadeloupe. The study is based on an analysis and a forecast model of global solar radiation, by including spatial and temporal parameters. The literature shows that an important number of sites is generally used for a spatio-temporal analysis, which would imply for us, to put multiple sensors on the whole territory. The costs of such a system would be considerable. Our approach here will consist in making a spatiotemporal analysis on three stations.  With few stations and not uniform distances, we, thus, tried to define a short-term forecast model of global solar radiation, in spite of these constraints which do not answer to a classic approach. The model is based on a methodology the VAR ( Autoregressive Vector) including spatial and temporal parameters. A strategy of selection of variables is developed to select useful predictors (stations) for the forecast on localization. This iterative strategy, on one hand will allow being closer to the reality, on the other hand to the point of algorithmic view, the trend of the calculations will be faster. Preliminarily, a study of the spatiotemporal variability of global solar radiation, allowed to quantify and to characterize in a fine way, the dynamic interactions between these three stations. Compared with the models of the literature, our forecast model shows a good performance with relative RMSE values going from 17.48 % to 23.79 % for horizons from 5 min to 1 hour. The developed methodologies could eventually offer an opportunity to assure guarantees to the network manager. If in the future the successful solutions of forecast became widespread, this opportunity would allow the opening of the market beyond the 30 % threshold imposed at present.","Epilepsy is a neurological disorder caused by abnormal neuron activity in the brain. Around 1% of the population worldwide is affected by it. Numerous motor manifestations (including convulsions, tonic, clonic, hyperkinetic changes) can be observed and are a source of major disability for patients. The motivation of this research is to develop methods based on recent machine learning techniques to provide objective analysis for clinical seizure videos.In this thesis, we propose three main contributions towards automated vision-based seizure analysis. In the first contribution, we explore some hyperkinetic epileptic seizures by analyzing the head movement trajectories of the patients. The results provide a basis for studying the correlation between the spectrum of EEG and the head movement frequency. Nevertheless, epilepsy is not the only cause that gives rise to a seizure event. For example, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are one of them. They are events resembling an epileptic seizure (ES), but without the characteristic electrical discharges associated with epilepsy. How to distinguish them is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up treatments. The clinical signs or semiology are evaluated by neurologists, but the subjective interpretation is liable for inter-observer variability. Hence, there is an urgent need to build an automated system to analyze seizure videos with the latest computer vision progress. In this research, we propose two other contributions for classifying ES and PNES solely based on the videos. Our second contribution utilizes multi-stream information from appearance and key-points for both the bodies and faces of the patients. In addition by introducing the knowledge distillation mechanism, the performance of the F1-score and the accuracy are 0.85 and 0.82. Furthermore, based on this approach, we conduct a side experiment for distinguishing ES with emotion\u002fnon-emotion and dystonia\u002fnon-dystonia based on the face and body streams in the method. The LOSO validation gives satisfactory results, indicating our model can capture effective spatio-temporal features for face and body for seizure analysis. In our third contribution, we propose a two-step model which is first pre-trained on large contextual videos then this model is fine-tuned for seizure type classification.The model is based on the encoder of the Transformer model. Given that it is expensive to get large datasets labeled by doctors, we try to leverage large unlabeled data for a good weight initialization point for the model, and then fine-tune it on the target downstream task. This model only processes the appearance features but more cases than those in the first study are involved.The F1-score and accuracy of the LOSO validation are 0.82 and 0.75. With the very encouraging results in this research, we demonstrate a basis for a promising research direction in the field of automated seizure video analysis.","Liquid foams are dispersions of bubbles in water and they are widely used in a large number of technical processes and commercial applications. In the present thesis I focus on different problems concerning properties of aqueous foams and especially gravity-driven flows in foams. Foams contain a large quantity of interfaces covered by surfactant molecules and the surfactant exchange between bulk and interface plays a crucial role for foam generation and stability. So my first project  was to study the adsorption dynamics of model surfactant systems at air\u002fwater interfaces.  The obtained results helped us to understand how the slow surfactant adsorption during foam generation can influence the  mobility of interfaces and  change foam drainage. To study different aspects of foam physics at the bubble scale simplified quasi-2D foams (monolayers of bubbles squeezed between two plates) are widely used. In this thesis a model to describe the geometry of a quasi-2D foam was introduced, this description was used to model the electrical and flow conductivities of such foams. In some applications (for example, in the paper and paint industries) foam formation can cause serious problems and suitable antifoaming agents need to be used. In my thesis the influence of gravity on the antifoaming efficiency of silicone oil droplets has been experimentally studied using parabolic flights. The results show that antifoam particles need gravity to be efficiently transported, and microgravity can render highly efficient antifoam practically useless. Being initially motivated by particle transport in foams, I have also looked at the  sedimentation of solid particles in vertical and inclined glass capillaries.","We study the hamiltonian dynamics of free particles in inelastic Lorentz gases, which are environments with an infinite number of degrees of freedom randomly or periodically distributed in space. We exhibit two differents asymptotic behaviours, depending on if the particles undergo dissipation or not.The model is called non-dissipative when the action of the particles on the degrees of freedom of the gas is neglected. We determine, numerically and analytically, the asymptotic behaviour in time of the averaged kinetic energy and the mean squared displacement of fast particles. The analysis is based on the approximation of the particles' dynamics by a random walk where one step corresponds to a unique collision of the particle with a particle of the Lorentz gas. We find different asymptotics, depending on whether the force exerted by the scatterer is or not a gradient field.  These results are proved by probabilistic arguments, bringing into play convergence theorems of Markov chains and Bessel processes. We also derive the asymptotic behavior of the main squared displacement in these different cases.In dissipative models, the evolution of the degrees of freedom of the Lorentz gas is affected by the particle and the dynamical system considered is constituted of the particle and the environment. It then has an infinite number of degrees of freedom. We prove, on an appropriate phase space, the global existence of solutions and build a Gibbs measure describing the system's thermodynamic equilibrium. This enables us to prove the Einstein relation at finite time in the presence of an exterior force.","Several decades after the discovery of the first debris disks and exoplanets, lots of questions remain regarding the mechanisms of formation and evolution of planetary systems. The recent progress of high-resolution high-contrast direct imaging, illustrated by the instruments VLT\u002fSPHERE and Gemini\u002fGPI, enables to unveil the outer architecture (\u003e 5 au) of young (\u003c 200 Myr) extrasolar systems when the dynamical interactions are frequent. This work sheds light on the origin and dynamical evolution mechanisms of planetary systems through the detailed study of key systems resolved with SPHERE and through the developing of dedicated tools.The first part of this manuscript tackles the subject of N-body simulations. Numerous algorithms have been proposed and implemented, with different compromises on their speed, accuracy, and versatility. Among these algorithms, SWIFT HJS allows us to model for secular times architectures that are very different from our Solar System. It is thus an essential tool to the study of planetary to stellar companions with non-negligible mass ratio, which are often encountered with direct imaging. Within my Ph.D., the functionalities of the algorithm were extended to handle hierarchy changes and close encounters, which can play an important part in the dynamical history of planetary systems. The code was used to study in detail the mysterious system HD 106906, in particular, the interactions between its main components (binary star, planet, debris disk).In the second part of the manuscript, I introduce the subject of orbital fitting. The observation of a system at different epochs allows theoretically to retrieve the characteristics of the orbits. However, the problem is often complex and degenerate, in particular when the observations span a small fraction of the orbital period. The widely used MCMC statistical approach enables to get robust estimates in most of the cases. These estimates are then used to study the history and stability of the system, and the interactions between the orbits and their environment, notably the disks. This role of orbital fitting is here illustrated by the study of several benchmark systems imaged with SPHERE.","Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) becomes a more and more demanded tool to improve the design of aero-engines. The main reason for this request stems from the constraints imposed on the next generation low-emission engines at the industrial development level and the ability for LES to provide information on the instantaneous turbulent flow field which greatly contributes to improving the prediction of mixing and combustion thereby offering an improved prediction of the exhaust emission. The work presented in this thesis discusses two recurring issues of LES. For one, numerical schemes for LES require certain properties, i.e. low-diffusion schemes of high order of accuracy so as not to interfere with the turbulence models. To meet this purpose in the context of fully unstructured solvers, a new family of high-order time-integration schemes is proposed. With this class of schemes, the diffusion implied by the numerical scheme become adjustable and built-in. Second, since fully unsteady by nature, LES is very consuming in terms of CPU time. Even with today's supercomputers complex problems require long simulation times. Due to the low flow velocities often occurring in industrial applications, the use of a low-Mach number solver seems suitable and can lead to large reductions in CPU time if comparable to fully compressible solvers. The impact of the incompressibility assumption and the different nature of the numerical algorithms are rarely discussed. To partly answer the question, detailed comparisons are proposed for an experimental swirled configuration representative of a real burner that is simulated by LES using a fully explicit compressible solver and an incompressible solution developed at CORIA","Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) mark periods of profound climatic, paleoenvironmental and paleoceanographical changes at a global scale, representing major disturbances in the global carbon cycle. OAEs are usually associated to major chemical changes in the Mesozoic Ocean, and the occurrence of organic-rich sediments, namely during the early Toarcian (T-OAE) and Cenomanian-Turonian (OAE2) events. Although global control mechanisms have a great influence in the shaping of these sedimentary records, their regional variability is extremely high. This heterogeneity is mostly related to regional constrains, being the organic record key to assess the extension of the influence of these mechanisms. Thus, organic petrographic and geochemical techniques were used to analyze a N-S transect of the Toarcian epicontinental seaway for the T-OAE, and, sections recording the Atlantic and Tethyan affinities for the OAE2. The T-OAE organic record is characterized by a N-S variation in total organic carbon (TOC) content, associated with a change in the organic matter (OM) origin (bacterial-animal-terrestrial), a decrease in the degree of amorphization, and a change in redox conditions (euxinic-anoxic-dysoxic-oxic). Studies on the evolution of the OM maturity demonstrate similar thermal histories for the Grands Causses and Quercy basins (immature to early mature). The South Pyrenean Zone underwent a more complex evolution (late mature to early overmature), while, in a laterally equivalent succession in the Eastern Corbi\u00e8res, solid bitumen, secondary OM products, were identified. The OAE2 organic record is extremely heterogenic, especially related to differences in oceanic circulation dynamics between the Tethyan and Atlantic domains. TOC content of OAE2 reaches higher maximum values than the ones associated with T-OAE, with the organic associations being dominated, in the majority of the studied sections, by amorphous OM. This study demonstrates, therefore, that the T-OAE and OAE2 organic facies variability is, in great part, explained by the diversity of the local paleoenvironmental contexts. Paleogeography, paleogeomorphology and oceanic circulation patterns variability are considered the main factors responsible for the organic signature of these events. In addition, this study constitutes the first record of Closterium in sediments from the Cretaceous, and the first identification of choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of Metazoa, in the fossil record.","Silicon carbide is a wide band-gap semiconductor with electrical and thermal characteristics particularly suitable for high power devices and radiation sensors. The realisation of UV detectors is mainly useful in the following sectors: fire detection, surface imagery, astronomy, medicine, military... The photodetectors based on wide band-gap semiconductors allow to get a very good selectivity, without using optical filters. Silicon carbide seems to be the most promising material, due to its chemical, mechanical and thermal stability, inducing a reliable behaviour in extreme environment. However SiC doping requires a distinct know-how (hot ion implantation, high temperature annealing, rapid heating-rate\u2026). Test devices have been firstly processed by using ion implantation and plasma, allowing evaluating p+n or n+p junction characteristics. After the optimisation of the technological parameters of implantation and related annealing, the realisation of radiation detectors based on Schottky or p.n diodes has been carried out. The electrical simulations of such devices were performed with Sentaurus Devices program (Synopsys). The characteristics of the devices proved an improvement with the Boron-plasma implantation.","The Trarza aquifer covers about 40 000 km2 in the south-western Mauritania in a semi-arid environment, located between the Senegal River in the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the metamorphic chain of Mauritanides in the north and east. The Trarza aquifer is made of Quaternary and Continental Terminal sediments. The objective of this work is to combine geochemical (majors ions, 18O, 2H, 14C, 13 C) and hydrodynamical approaches for identifying the groundwater recharge in response to current and past environmental changes. The field survey carried out from 2010 to 2012 significantly supplemented the limited older measurements. The water table levels appeared quite stable over the last fifty years despite important local pumping. The groundwater flows occurs from south to north, i.e. from the Senegal River to a depression north of the Boutilimit where the piezometric level is more than 30 m below the sea level. Combining geochemical and hydrodynamical approaches revealed that the dynamics of the aquifer is influenced by many changes in both current and former environment (from Quaternary transgressions and palaeobeds of the Senegal River to the dams now regulating the river flow). The main source of the aquifer recharge is lateral infiltration from the Senegal River, and precipitation to a lesser extent. Mineralization of groundwater is largely influenced by the residues of Quaternary transgressions. The important effect of evaporation on surface waters before and during their infiltration is strongly marked geochemical signature. Preliminary calculations performed with several independent methods suggest that the annual recharge rate from precipitation is up to 5 %, i.e. from 5 to 10 mm.","As milk production increased, reproductive performance of the dairy cows has decreased at each reproductive step (cyclicity, oestrus, fertility). The aim of this thesis is to identify milk production effects at each reproductive step. Apart from the direct genetic effects, body reserves level and dynamic are generally though to explain the adverse effects of high milk yield. Two hypotheses are tested: at a given genetic value, milk yield has an effect per se which is not mediated through body reserves evolution, and the hierarchy of these two effects varies according to the reproductive step. In order to uncouple these effects, Holstein and Normande cows bred in a compact calving system were submitted to two feeding strategies. The High feeding level allows high milk yield and moderate body condition loss. The Low one limits milk yield but triggers a deep body condition loss. Only the breed influenced final pregnancy rate. Oestrus was better detected in the Low group, in agreement with an enhanced oestradiol production by pre-ovulatory follicles of cows submitted to this feeding strategy. Early pregnancy failures were more frequent in the Low group; late embryo mortalities were more frequent in the High group for the Holstein breed only. Oestrus and early embryo development appear milk yield level and dynamic driven. Cyclicity, fertilization or early embryo development appear body reserves\u2019 evolution driven. Consequently, this work leads to a better understanding of the competition between milk production and reproduction in the dairy cow.","MEMS ohmic microswitches include very low force electrical contacts. These are very sensitive to parameters which reveal difficult to control. A previously developed modelization method consists in computing mechanical contact using finite elements, then estimating electrical resistance using analytical expressions. Here we focus on the possibilities of multiphysical finite element computations instead.Validation of the contact mechanical computation is first attempted, based on experimental results of previous works. Multiphysical contact computations are carried out. Resulting electrical contact resistance isfound to be much lower than experimental results. The presence of insulating surface films is supposedly the cause for that. Eventually, a simplified geometry for asperities is used to build models with insulating films.The most relevant models feature \u201cnanospots\u201d: some very small conductive areas are scattered on the contact area. The results allow us to determine some possible geometry configurations that could lead to contact resistance values such as those measured on real devices.","In this thesis we study the holonomies of complex projective structures on surfaces. In a first part, we define a class of representations of the fundamental group of a closed surface of genus two into the group of M\u00f6bius transformations: the pentagon representations. We show that they are exactly the representations that do not admit a Schottky decomposition: a pants decomposition such that the restriction of the representation to each pair of pants is an isomorphism onto a Schottky group. In doing so, we exhibit a gap in the proof of Gallo, Kapovich and Marden that these holonomies are the non-elementary representations in the connected component of the corresponding character variety that contains the trivial representation. By studying these representations we repair their proof. In a second part, we study periods of abelian differentials. We characterize the homomorphisms from the first homology group of a closed surface into the complex numbers that appear as the absolute periods of a translation surface in a given stratum of the moduli space of those. Finally in a third part we characterize the homomorphisms of the fundamental group of a closed surface into the group of M\u00f6bius trnasformations that appear as holonomy of a branched complex projective with fixed combinatorics of branched points. In doing so we study the action of the mapping class group of a closed surface on the corresponding character variety.","As bioisosteres of quinazolinones and benzofuranes respectively, thienopyrimidinones and thienofuranes can be envisioned as promising precursors for the design of potential bioactive compounds, especially anti-angiogenic molecules. Tumoral angiogenesis plays an important role in the tumor growth and metastasis of cancer. Therefore, one of the most studied anti-cancer strategies implies the design of small kinase inhibitors, targeting more specifically VEGFR-2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), which is considered as key component in the angiogenic process. In this context, our work has essentially focused on the synthesis of new series of thienopyrimidinone and thienofuran derivatives with potential inhibitory activity of VEGFR-2. For each of the designed structures, we have first studied, by 3D-QSAR, the influence of various modulations of the heterocyclic core (including substitution and isomery of the core, nature of the extending chain) on the predicted activity. Then, we have elaborated several synthetic pathways allowing access to the targeted compounds. Selective synthesis of a choosen thienofuran isomer has been performed through a chemoselective methodology starting from wisely functionalized 3-O-alkylated thiophenes. These molecules could be then further functionalized to access to final compounds. Simultaneously, synthesis of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinone derivatives has been carried out according to two strategies : a convergent pathway allowed a direct introduction of some of the envisioned modulations on the central core in nitrogen series (linking heteroatom), while a linear pathway has ensured the desired modulations on oxygen and sulfur series","Transcription of the lactoferrin gene results in the production of two isoforms: a secreted lactoferrin (Lf) and intracellular delta-lactoferrin (\u0394Lf). Lf has numerous functions including immunomodulatory and antitumoral activities. We showed that \u0394Lf is a transcription factor, the only activity it shares with Lf being its anticancer activity. Lf and \u0394Lf are potential tumor suppressors whose expression is downregulated in the case of cancer. They may be considered as healthy markers, the expression of which is correlated with a good prognosis in breast cancer. During my PhD thesis, We developed quantitative Taqman PCR assay to evaluate the level of expression of the transcripts of the two Lf isoforms in case of cancer or in an inflammatory context. We then studied the proteome profile of \u0394Lf-expressing cells using 2-D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analyses. Our data established that DcpS, a key enzyme in mRNA decay, is a new target of \u0394Lf transcriptional activity. In parallel, we demonstrated that \uf044Lf stability and transcriptional activity are regulated by O-GlcNAcylation. Finally, We compare the differential effects of the two antitumoral isoforms on the cancerous mammary gland MDA-MB-231 cell line. We used a high-throughput proteomic approach (Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino acids in Cell culture, SILAC) coupled to mass spectrometry to carry out highly accurate quantitative and systematic proteome profiling in collaboration with the team of Dr. Monsarrat (IPBS, Toulouse). Our study allowed the identification of SelH, a thioredoxin like protein, as a target of both Lf and \u0394Lf transcriptional activity and suggested that secreted Lf acts as a transcription factor.","We have studied the behaviour of thixotropic fluids : especially the suspension of laponite. The study of the local level of this suspension, with the help of PIV technique, which allows to better understanding how the organisation of suspension structure when the fluid starts to flow. The study of the validation and the good response of the developed model are achieved by a comparative study between the existing model of Herschel-Bulkley and the measuring of velocity fields. In the case of studied geometry \u201ccoaxial disks\u201d, the PIV experimental measuring allows us to identify the existence of two distinct layers when the fluid flows. Indeed, we have observed that the first layer is near to the rotating disc where the fluid is motionless and takes the form of a cone which corresponds to a region near the bottom of the cylinder. The use of commercial CFD code Star-CD has enabled us to highlight the limitations of the model of Herschel-Bulkley in relation to the experimental results. These results were used as reference for comparison with the model of dual kinetic behaviour developed in this work. It was shown that the behaviour of the latter model presents a better matching with the actual behaviour of the flowing suspension although some problems still remain.","This thesis presents the study of electrons, phonons and their dynamics in the phase transitions of two strongly correlated materials, the prototype Mott compound (V1-xCrx)2O3 and the superconducting iron-pnictide Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. These systems were studied with two complementary techniques, photoelectron spectroscopy and pump-probe reflectivity. Transient reflectivity measurements in (V1-xCrx)2O3 show a photo-induced lattice stiffening, due to the ultrafast (at the femtosecond time-scale) electronic structure modification. Coherent optical and acoustic phonon measurements investigated the Iink between electronic excitation, lattice properties and electron correlations. Sub-micron spatially resolved photoemission allowed the measurement of coexisting Mott-insulating and metallic domains in some parts of the phase diagram. Ln Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2, the first measurement of a coherent optical phonon in an iron-pnictide compound made it possible to interpret the transient electronic relaxation as governed by a selective electron-phonon coupling. The coupling constant, \u03bb=0. 12, is too weak to explain the superconductivity by a phonon mediated mechanism. The electronic structure of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 has been measured by angle-resolved photoemission at low photon energy, allowing an optimal wavevector and energy resolution. The band dispersion and their orbital origin close to the Brillouin zone center have been determined, and the changes in the electronic structure induced by superconductivity have been measured. These changes include a spectral weight transfer and selective gap opening, revealing the complex character of the electronic structure of this multi-band superconductor.","Stroke is the leading cause of death in women and the 3rd in men, as well as the leading cause of dependency in surviving people because they have major neurological sequelae. The deficiencies are mainly functional and only 5 to 25% of patients will recover a functional upper limb. Spontaneous functional recovery, which is maximal within 3 months after the onset of stroke, is mainly underpinned by brain plasticity mechanisms. Mechanisms that can be boosted by different rehabilitation techniques, including pharmacological substances or brain stimulation techniques that are developed for this purpose. Quantifying the capacities of each patient is essential to determine the lost functions and thus propose appropriate rehabilitation protocols. Many techniques have demonstrated their evaluation potential. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of stroke patients performing a motor task, has made it possible to better define the temporal course of brain reorganization associated with motor recovery. In fact, fMRI measures are proposed as prognostic factors. Resting-state fMRI is increasingly being used to study changes in brain connectivity induced by the lesion or by a given therapeutic intervention. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS), in addition to being used as a rehabilitation tool, are also used as assessment tools to study the recovery and efficacy of therapies. In addition, in recent years, more and more authors have recommended the use of kinematic measurements for more objective and automatic patient assessment after stroke. This kinematic assessment, which can be carried out using rehabilitation robots, would also make it possible to differentiate the strategies implemented during post-stroke recovery. In order for the changes measured by TMS or robotic tools to correctly reveal this effectiveness, the parameters obtained must be reproducible, valid and reliable. Thus, the objective of my thesis is to study the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies on brain plasticity and in the motor recovery of the upper limb after a stroke in parallel to find the appropriate measures to best evaluate these effects. Through data obtained from six clinical protocols involving healthy subjects or stroke patients, it was possible to highlight the potential of a measurement tool and\u002for intervention technique to measure or even stimulate the mechanisms underlying motor recovery in stroke.","The aim of this work is to synthesize model materials (epitaxial thin films) of ternary ceramics called MAX phases, in order to study their behavior under ion irradiation. To follow the microstructural modifications induced by ion irradiation, we used electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy in addition to X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The growth of Cr2AlC and Cr2GeC epitaxial thin films was achieved by magnetron sputtering whereas the synthesis of textured Ti2AlN layers was obtained by high temperature plasma nitriding of multilayers with an average st\u0153chiometry Ti2:Al1:N1. The electronic structure of unirradiated films of de Cr2AlC, Cr2GeC, Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2 and Ti2AlN was then characterized. Experimental spectra were interpreted from ab initio simulations. This study shows that structural information may be obtained from fine structures of core electron excitation edges. After irradiation, the study of the C-K and Al-K near-edge fine structures in Ti3AIC2 evidences that Ti6C octahedra layers are very resistant to irradiation damage and on the contrary, aluminium layers are strongly disordered. A similar behavior is suggested for Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN and also partly for Cr2AlC. Though titanium based materials are still crystalline after irradiation at high fluence, chronium based compounds rapidly amorphize. It is evidenced that the initial crystalline structure is recovered after post-irradiation annealing.","The expectations around graphene come from huge potentialities for various applications (RF transistor, (bio)sensors\u2026). Graphene high specific surface, mechanical resistance and conductivity make it specifically attractive for electrochemical storage applications. It has been shown that graphene sheets could be assembled to form structured graphene frameworks to translate the properties of individual sheets to functional materials and allow practical applications. The key features of these frameworks in terms of electrochemical storage applications are their graphitization level, their structural or textural disorder, and their porosity. On another hand, graphene has been interfaced with molecules to tune its electrical\u002foptical properties or to make it more processable.     The goal of the PhD project is to develop such structured graphene matrices following different methods such as the functionalization with bi-functional pilar molecules or the aerogel formation techniques. These assemblies will then be modified with different molecules to favor the formation of a stable SEI (solid electrolyte interface) and the intercalation of ions. The immobilization of redox compounds will also be attempted in order to bring a pseudo capacitive component to the system and target pseudo-capacitor applications.    This thesis work will include material synthesis, assembling and functionalization steps combined to an important characterization tasks (IR, XRD, XPS, MEB, TEM, BET, electrochemistry...) The added-value of such work is that it represents an approach going from the basic material develop to the proof of concept.","Studying past biodiversity in the context of biotic crisis is essential to understand the current environmental crisis. To do so, conodonts are used to study the consequences of disturbances at the Permian\u002fTriassic boundary and in the Triassic period. Usually known by their buccal elements, their biostratigraphic qualities make them an ideal model for studying biodiversity in deep time. Three axes are developed during this thesis, the first dealing with the effect of sampling on species delimitation and the contribution of environment and development in macroevolutionary patterns. The first aspect is studied by testing the specific classification of 160 elements of an Early Triassic assemblage by quantifying diagnostic characters and variation in the number of individuals. The results show that abundant material does not allow a better taxonomic identification. The second aspect is tested by quantifying the shape of elements from a Late Triassic assemblage. The results show that if the environment affects the morphological evolution of the conodonts, developmental constraints are preserved. The second axis deals with biogeographic patterns and underlying processes (niche vs. dispersion). These aspects are studied with a database of global occurrences of Early Triassic conodonts. If their biogeographic distribution has evolved over time, it is mainly due to dispersion. The last axis aimed at refining the biogeography of the Early Triassic conodonts by elaborating a global biostratigraphic scheme using the Unitary Associations method. The resulting association zones are discussed in relation to the stratigraphic limits already established","For years, the energy consumption of the data center has dramatically increased followed by the explosion of demand in cloud computing. This thesis addresses the scientific challenge of energy modeling of a data center, based on the most important variables. With such modeling, an data center operator will be able to better reallocate \u002f design the current \u002f future data centers. In order to identify the energy impacts of hardware and software used in computer systems. In the first part of the thesis, to identify and characterize the uncertainties of energy consumption introduced by external elements: thermal effects, difference between identical processors caused by imperfect manufacturing process, precision problems resulting from power measurement tool, etc. We have completed this scientific study by developing a global power modeling for a given physical cluster, this cluster is composed by 48 identical servers and equipped with a direct expansion cooling system, conventionally used today for modern data centers. The modeling makes it possible to estimate the overall energy consumption of the cluster based on operational configurations and data relating to IT activity, such as ambient temperature, cooling system configurations and server load.","Stacking a multiprocessor (MPSoC) layer and a FPGA layer to form a 3D Reconfigurable System-on- Chip (3DRSoC) is a promising solution giving a high flexibility level in adapting the architecture to the targeted application. For an application defined as a graph of parallel tasks running on the 3DRSoC system, one of the main challenges comes from the high-level management of tasks. This management is done by the scheduling service of the Operating System and it must be able to determine, on the fly, what task should be run in software and\u002for hardware, when (temporal dimension) and where (spatial dimension, i.e. on what processor or what area of the FPGA) in order to achieve high performance of the system. In this thesis, we propose online spatio-temporal scheduling strategies for 3DRSoCs. The first strategy decides, during the task scheduling, the need for a SW task and a HW task to communicate in face-to-face so that the communication cost between tasks is minimized. The second strategy aims at minimizing the overall execution time of the application. It exploits the presence of processors in the MPSoC layer in order to anticipate, at run-time, the SW execution of a task when its HW version cannot be allocated to the FPGA. Then, a graphical simulation tool has been developed to verify the proper functioning of the developed strategies and also enable us to produce results.","The present PhD work concerns the effect of thermo-mechanical texturing by DIC (Instantaneous Controlled Pressure-Drop) on fruit and vegetable drying. This pretreatment dramatically improves drying kinetics when the internal mass transfer coupled to the shrinkage of the product, is the limiting process. Indeed, the drying time decreased by 67% in the case of onion and 77% for blackcurrants, while the effective diffusivity Deff increased up to 246%, 795%, 336%, and 1223% for cranberry seed and waste, onion and blackcurrants, respectively. With these products, the saturated steam pressure generally has a significant positive effect on the drying kinetics.DIC treatment significantly improves the main nutritional and functional characteristics of the fruits and vegetables, with more available phenols and higher antioxidant activity. As thermal degradation is negligible, the DIC treatment involves micromechanical effect linked to the instant pressure drop, which allows cell to break and structure to be more porous such increasing the maximum extractable amount. Various physical, microstructural and functional characteristics of new textured material allow water interaction to be completely modified in terms of rehydration kinetics and capacity, sorption isotherm, microbiological and nutritional content... depending on operating DIC conditions, which can be optimized according to the consumer needs.","Since the arrival of the Web, various kinds of semi-structured data formats were introduced in the areas of computer science and technology relevant for the Web, such as document processing, database management, knowledge representation, and information exchange. In this thesis, we study the conversion of semi-structured data from one schema to another.For document processing, the most powerful solutions to this problem were proposed by the XML technology. In the XML format, semi-structured data is restricted to data trees, so that schemas can be defined by tree automata, possibly enhanced by constraints on data values. Document transformations can be defined in XSLT, a purely functional programming language with logical XPath queries. The core of XSLT are macros tree transducers with navigation by XPath queries.We contribute new learning algorithms on tree transducers, that are based on methods from grammatical inference. We address three limitiations of previous approaches: schema restrictions, lookaheads, and concatenation in the output.1. For deterministic top-down tree transducers with regular domain inspection, we show a normal form and a Gold style learning algorithm in with limited resources.2. We show how to learn rational functions, described by deterministic transducers of words with lookahead. We propose a new normal form for such transducers which provides a compromise between lookahead and state minimization, that leads to a learning algorithm in Gold\u2019s learning model with polynomial resources.3. For linear tree-to-word transducers with concatenation in the output, we present a normal form and show how to decide equivalence in polynomial time.","At an application level, this thesis deals with the layout of an accommodation intended for a disabled person. Determining the layout means choosing the position, shape and dimensions of rooms, doors and corridors. It is usually an architect's job but the complexity is such that it is very unlikely that he succeeds in optimally fulfilling all the constraints: first, there are architectural constraints: no room overlapping, sufficient width for the corridors, accessibility to and from any point, mandatory positioning of some rooms on some areas (e.g. water supply and outlet) \u2026 Then, there are constraints imposed by disabilities: enlarged corridors (wheelchairs), mandatory daily amount of efforts (fight against aging), reducing the number of steps (severe asthma), moving a room away from shared walls (deafness)... Finally, there are the wishes expressed by the future occupant, such as minimizing some journeys, maximizing the distance between two rooms or fixing a room's orientation. From a formal point of view, our work has consisted, firstly, in developing mathematical models and algorithmic methods to deal with all these constraints and, secondly, in realizing software prototypes applying these concepts. The tools we propose aim either at optimizing a layout previously designed by an architect or at synthesising a layout without any initial suggestions from the architect. Synthesis has been tackled as bin-packing-type problem (known to be NP-hard) but with additional constraints: the objects to be placed (the rooms) have variable sizes and they are submitted to functional constraints. The resolution is based on a first, initially quadratic and then linearized, mixed integer mathematical model. It has been successfully applied to position and dimension the rooms of an accommodation, to determine corridors allowing a full accessibility to all the rooms and to take into account a number of constraints coming from the disabilities of the future occupant. A second mathematical model has been formulated for the positioning of the doors and, finally, a heuristic method has been designed to assign the space used by useless corridors to adjacent rooms. The whole process has been embedded in a fully operational software. The second set of contributions is about the optimization of an existing layout. This task has been tackled through an iterative process, looping on evaluation and modification (improvement) of an accommodation. It has been implemented in four different ways: a metaheuristic (simulated annealing) and three local-search-type methods, which traverse the solution space by using specific definitions of the neighbourhood. This approach has firstly underlined the multicriteria feature of our problem and, secondly, has required the development of many computational geometry algorithms. All this work is integrated in another functional prototype software. To understand the expectations of the scientific, social and professional worlds, this project has implied to take part to various manifestations which were national or regional, in the computer science domain or in others, scientific or non-scientific, organised by various political or non-political organisations working in the field of disabilities and accessibility. This phase has resulted in many reports which have directly fed into the bibliography of this thesis.","The increasing needs of high frequency electronic systems combined with constant efforts in miniaturization require low noise and high frequency Field Effect Transistor with high operation voltage. For digital applications, enhancement mode HEMT is needed. The enhancement-mode metamorphic AlInAs\u002fGaInAs HEMT on GaAs substrate developed in OMMIC in 2007 meet these requirements and  it represents the starting point of our study. The aim of our work is to provide AlInAs\u002fInGaAs E-HEMTs for low noise applications, on InP substrate in order to take advantage of its high electronic mobility, while maintaining high static and dynamic performances. We first optimized the structure, then we realized and characterized E-HEMTs which reach high cutoff frequencies, such as 204 GHz for FT and 327 GHz for FMAX, combined with a low noise figure of 0.96 dB and an associated gain of 13.2 dB at 30 GHz. These structures also show high static performances such as a 30 mV threshold voltage, a gate-to-drain breakdown voltage of \u20137 V, and a high transconductance of 1040 mS\u002fmm. These results make this pseudomorphic E-HEMT on InP substrate at the state of the art of the enhancement mode HEMTs, and it even competes with the best low noise applications depletion mode HEMTs.","This work is concerned with the theoretical description of the Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) in general and with solving particular models of the quantum point contact (QPC) nanostructure, analytically and numerically. SGM is an experimental technique, which measures the conductance of a nanostructure, while a charged AFM tip is scanned above its surface. It gives many interesting results, such as lobed and branched images, interference fringes and a chequerboard pattern. A generally applicable theory, allowing for unambiguous interpretation of the results, is still missing. Using the Lippman-Schwinger scattering theory, we have developed a perturbative description of non-invasive SGM signal. First and second order expressions are given, pertaining to the ramp- and plateau-regions of the conductance curve. The maps of time-reversal invariant (TRI) systems, tuned to the lowest conductance plateau, are related to the Fermi-energy charge density. In a TRI system with a four-fold spatial symmetry and very wide leads, the map is also related to the current density, on any plateau. We present and discuss the maps calculated for two analytically solvable models of the QPC and maps obtained numerically, with Recursive Green Function method, pointing to the experimental features they reproduce and to the fundamental difficulties in obtaining good plateau tuning which they reveal.","Maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes is essential for cellular integrity and function. P4-ATPases, from the P-type ATPases family, are energy-dependent transporters, together with their CDC50 accessory subunits couple ATP hydrolysis to lipid transport from the exoplasmic to cytoplasmic leaflet to maintain membrane asymmetry.Drs2p is one of these P4-ATPases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Drs2p is localised in trans-Golgi (TGN) membranes in association with its binding partner Cdc50p, which contributes to the correct addressing of Drs2p and probably in the catalyzed transport by Drs2p. Drs2p transport principally phosphatidylserine (PS) in TGN membranes. The PS is important for a several signalling pathways, for example, in apoptosis and recruitment of the proteins implied in various essential cellular process, so, it's very important to understand the mechanism that establishes this asymmetry.To gain in comprehension of molecular mechanism of lipid transport, robust protocols for expression and purification are required. In this work, we present a procedure for high-yield  co-expression of Drs2p and Cdc50p. The purification of Drs2p and Cdc50p is achieved in a single step by affinity chromatography on streptavidin beads, yielding, 1-2 mg purified Drs2p\u002fCdc50p per liter of culture. This procedure allows purification of the complex Drs2p\u002fCdc50p with stoichiometry to 1:1. Our complex is functional, overal ATP hydrolysis by the complex is dependent of  PS, favourite substrate of Drs2p. This hydrolyze is critically dependent on the presence of PI4P, a phosphoinositide involved in regulation of membrane trafficking.Like many P-type ATPases auto-regulate their activity, we examined the possibility that P4-ATPases are auto-regulated. In this work, we use directed mutagenesis and limited proteolysis associated with mass spectrometry for identify peptides. We show that limited proteolysis of a purified complex Drs2p\u002fCdc50p resulted in up to a 30-50 fold increase of it ATPase activity, which however remained dependent on PI4P. Using thrombin as the protease, Cdc50p remained intact and in complex with Drs2p, which was cleaved at two positions, namely after R104 and after R1290. Our results therefore reveal that trimming off appropriate regions of the terminal extensions of Drs2p can increase its ATPase activity in the presence of PI4P by an enormous factor, thereby identifying a role of N and\u002for C-terminal extensions in auto-inhibition of Drs2p.Our results open perspectives on the structural and the functional characterization of the lipid transport mechanism by the complex Drs2p\u002fCdc50p. Furthermore, our procedures open up the possibility of studying the molecular bases of the pathologies associated with the mutations of human P4-ATPases.","The boom in laparoscopic surgery means that new anesthetic strategies must be found, especially with respect to post-operative analgesia. Topical administration of local anesthetics is part of multimodal analgesia and many studies seeking to establish its interest in laparoscopic surgery provide contradictory results. Our aim is to contribute to an optimum way of administrating local anesthetics topically, with a view to: 1)homogeneous spreading on the peritoneum, 2)simultaneous humidification of insufflation gas, in order to prevent hypothermia. Hypothermia is due to evaporation of the peritoneum\u2019s surface by contact with dry insufflation gas. Humidification could prevent this thermal energy loss. We performed several in vitro and in vivo (animal-) studies. Firstly, we evaluated the efficiency of hot versus cold humidification in hypothermia prevention. Secondly, we evaluated several humidification devices in order to assess their efficiency in delivering ropivacaine in the insufflation gas flow. Finally, we performed a pharmacokinetic study of intraperitoneal ropivacaine nebulization, by comparison with standard instillation. Our results open new prospects for intraperitoneal topical administration of local anesthetics: in the animal setting, we showed that hot humidification of insufflated gas did not provide any benefit in hypothermia prevention, in comparison with cold humidification, we established the potential value of a nebulizer, able to humidify and deliver local anesthetics along with CO2 insufflation during laparoscopy, we performed the first pharmacokinetic study of intraperitoneal ropivacaine nebulization, validating the safety of the technique. These results enable us to follow our research with a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of nebulized ropivaca\u00efne and humidified insufflation gas in laparoscopic surgery.","During winter, local strong winds (Mistral or Tramontana) occurred in the Gulf of Lion which bring cold and dry continental air over a warmer sea. Those events, the cold air outbreaks, can lead to intense air-sea interactions which favour dense water formation and deep oceanic convection. The representation of air-sea exchanges is a fundamental aspect of of climate modelling and numerical weather forecasting. The ASICS-MED project aims to identify fine-scale processes leading to dense water formation and is a part of the \"Intense air-sea exchanges\" topic of the HyMeX program devoted to hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean. The processes occurring within the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and the oceanic mixing layer (ML) interact with one another at different spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the overall evolution of the MABL but also the local mechanisms requires taking into account all the processes. The study presented here is devoted to the mean and turbulent structure of the MABL under strong wind conditions. The objective is to determine how the organization of the turbulent field is impacted during CAO events and to estimate the surface fluxes associated with these strong wind conditions. The methodology adopted is based on the joint use of airborne observations collected during the HyMeX-SOP2 field campaign and numerical simulations. The HyMeX-SOP2 field campaign took place during the winter of 2013 in the Gulf of Lion. The research aircraft ATR42 was operated to document the mean and turbulent structure of the MABL during 11 CAO events. A spectral analysis based on an analytic model was carried out on 181 legs (i.e. stacked straight and level runs stabilized in altitude). The vertical profiles of the turbulent characteristic scales as well as the shape of the vertical velocity spectrum revealed an elongation of the energy structures in the mean wind direction associated with the organization of the turbulent field into longitudinal rolls. A unidirectional sampling of the three-dimensional turbulent field may lead to a limited representativeness of the coherent structures within the samples. However, knowledge of kinematic fluxes profiles over the entire thickness of the CLAM is necessary to estimate air-sea exchanges. A correction method was applied to turbulent fluxes calculated by eddy correlation in order to take into account systematic and random errors related to measurement and data processing. This correction made it possible to determine the best possible estimates of the extrapolated surface fluxes with a margin of uncertainty for the 11 CAO events documented during the HyMeX-SOP2 field campaign. The comparison of these airborne estimates with the other sources of information derived from bulk parameterizations show a systematic underestimation of the latent heat flux under strong wind conditions. A numerical approach allowed to complete the analysis of the mean and turbulent structure of the MABL during CAO events. The numerical study, based on the non-hydrostatic Meso-NH model, focuses on an episode of strong Tramontana with winds greater than 25m\u002fs documented during the HyMeX-SOP2 field campaign. In a first step, a one-dimensional framework made it possible to understand the forcing terms necessary to reproduce in a realistic way the development of the observed MABL. This reference configuration allowed, in a second time, a Large-Eddy Simulation of the CAO event. This simulation has been validated using airborne data and has allowed to deepen the description of the turbulent field as well as the evolution of the coherent structures oriented in the axis of the mean wind.","Every autumn, incidents related to the degradation of the adhesion of a wheel-rail contact are reported by train drivers. This is caused especially by the presence of dead leaves on the surface of a rail. They cause security problems and numerous delays occuring mainly at the beginning and end of a day. At these times, the air temperature reaches the dew point temperature, creating moisture on the rail surface. Oxides reacting with the dead leaves on the rails generate physical and chemical changes in this third body. When a train is passing over this organic layer, mechanical stresses are generated decreasing the adhesion of the contact. The objective of this study is to present a tribological approach aimed at characterising the adhesion of a wheel-rail contact with a third external organic body. To do this, two axes of study are followed.The first one consists in a capitalisation of the results and limits of the most relevant research works carried out on this subject. This is used to create a collection of tribological, mechanical and physico-chemical data. It is completed by morphological analyses of real third bodies taken from tracks following an adhesion loss.The second axis of study consists of carrying out a parametric test campaign on the Triboring test bench, which is a ring-roller type tribometer representative of a wheel-rail contact at a 1\u002f15 scale. The study of adhesion variations is thus carried out by taking into account the mechanical and physico-chemical interactions linked to the addition of a third organic body. The latter are highlighted through an analysis of mechanical (friction factor), energetic (energy dissipated by friction) and spectroscopic (chemical bonding, composition) quantities. Finally, the activation of several tribological flows highlights repeatable phenomena modifying the consequences of a train\u2019s adhesion loss on the distances traveled. This research work is being carried out in partnership with SNCF R\u00e9seau, using multidisciplinary tools (tribology, mechanics, physical chemistry) that combine experimental data (from real tracks and representative experiments of the wheel-rail contact) with tribological and physical-chemical analysis.","Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), resulting from heterozygous germline mutations of TP53, is one of the most severe hereditary cancer syndromes. In order to determine the molecular basis of the clinical gradient of germline TP53 mutations, we studied the functional consequences of the different types of TP53 mutations in the genetic context of the patients, and we showed that TP53 missense mutations with dominant-negative effect alter the p53 transcriptional response to DNA damage more drastically than null mutations. These results indicate that the impact of the mutations on p53 transcriptional response to DNA damage in LFS lymphocytes can be considered as an endophenotype of the clinical severity of germline TP53 mutations. The use of the simple p53 functional assay allowed us to confirm these observations on a large number of mutations. ChIP-Seq analysis performed on lymphocytes derived from TP53 wild-type control subject and LFS patient with TP53 dominant-negative missense, showed that the drastic alteration of p53 transcriptional response to DNA in LFS lymphocytes harboring dominant negative missense mutations, is explained by a massive and global alteration of p53 DNA binding. In order to determine the causative role of chemotherapies in the appearance of secondary tumours in LFS, we developed a new genotoxicity assay, named the p53 genotoxicity assay. This assay allowed us to show that most of the drugs commonly used in cancer treatment, except the microtubule poisons, are highly genotoxic. Thus, in TP53 mutation carriers, germline TP53 mutations represent a genetic permissive context facilitating the malignant transformation of cells in which DNA damage has occurred.","Pyroclastic flows are hot mixtures of gas and particles that can propagate over large distances. This high \u201cmobility\u201d is often attributed to their ability to be fluidized, that is, to generate and retain high gas pore pressure that reduces internal friction forces. The main objective of this thesis is to understand how irregularities of substrates on which pyroclastic flows propagate can enhance their fluidization. A first set of laboratory experiments consisted of the generation of fine-grained flows (diameter of 45-90 \u03bcm) on substrate of various roughness. Results show that the flow runout distance increases with the substrate roughness, and is up to twice the runout on a smooth substrate. High speed video analyses and air pore pressure measurements at the flow base show that the flow head propagating over a rough substrate can auto-fluidize because of particles sedimentation into the substrate interstices, which forces the air to escape upward and percolate through the flow. This auto-fluidization mechanism is efficient at all inclinations investigated (0-30\u00b0), suggesting that it could occur during the whole emplacement of a pyroclastic flow. A second study consisted of the vertical release of beds of particles in a static column. Results show that the granular mixture can be fully fluidized, even when collapsing from a relatively low height (20 cm). When particles are fine enough (\u003c100 \u03bcm), pore pressure in the deposit diffuses for several seconds, the diffusion duration increasing with increasing bed thickness and decreasing particle size. The longest diffusion durations are observed for pyroclastic flow deposit materials (~30 s for 28.5 cm thick beds). These results suggest that pyroclastic flows propagating on irregular terrains can auto-fluidize and preserve low internal friction during their emplacement.","Ablative resins, ablative materials matrixes, can protect systems from high energy fluxes thanks to their specific degradation mechanism, especially in aerospace applications. Phenolic resins, usually used as matrix, run a risk of obsolescence due to the presence of free phenol and formaldehyde which are suspected of being mutagenic and carcinogenic, respectively. This thesis work then focusses on the development of chromene functional monomers, a technology capable of replacing such matrixes.Chromene monomers are reachable from phenolic substrates by functionalization and subsequent rearrangement of propargyl ether functional group. Three synthetic pathways have been explored and optimized starting from a difunctional model compound. Properties of resins obtained from such routes comply with the requirements, especially for their high char yield upon pyrolysis after polymerization. This study allowed the proposal of a radical polymerization mechanism for chromene monomers.This synthetic approach has been applied to various biobased phenolic substrates. The resulting polymers showed interesting properties that are discussed. This work allowed for the implementation and mechanistic discussion of a new cationic initiating system for chromene type monomers.","International agreements for the reduction of polluting emissions to the environment require the use of renewable energies in the electricity grid. In addition, the integration of storage devices is envisaged in the future electrical networks in order to solve the intermittence problems and to optimize the consumption of the users. However, due to the different characteristics of the electrical signals involved (DC current for renewable sources and batteries, AC current for the electrical network), the current structures consist on several cascaded converters. This results in a low energy density, higher costs and reduced efficiency for the system. In addition, the different voltage levels (battery voltages, renewable sources and power grid) and safety constraints often require the use of transformers to provide galvanic isolation and match the voltages.This thesis focuses on the design of an innovative three-port structure for the bidirectional power flows control between a renewable power source, a battery pack and the power grid (single phase or three-phase) with a single conversion stage. The TAB (Triple Active Bridge) structure has been chosen for this purpose, due to its many advantages such as galvanic isolation, soft switching (ZVS) in all of its active bridges (allowing to work at high switching frequency) and the possibility of an easy power flow control between the different sources. In this way, the analysis has established a methodology for the design of a TAB DC \u002f DC structure, a single-phase TAB DC \u002f AC structure, a single-phase TAB DC \u002f AC structure with a series connected active filter in order to achieve a \"single phase power decoupling\" and finally, for the design of a three-phase TAB DC \u002f AC structure.","The first aim of this study focuses on the apoptotic effect of Berberis Libanotica on human erythroleukemia cell lines HEL, K562, and K562(COX-2+) and it is effect on the expression of COX-2. In light of the reported chemopreventive and chemosensitive effects of natural products on various tumor cells and animal models, we postulated that our Bl extract may mediate their effects through apoptosis induction with suppression of cell survival pathways. We showed that this extract induces apoptosis in eryrhtroleukemia cells by activation of the late markers of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. In the other hand, we showed that Bl extract reduced significantly expression of COX-2 by a dose-dependent manner. In regard to our results, it is clear that the simultaneous inhibition of Akt and NF-\u03baB signalling can significantly contribute to the anticancer effects of Bl extract in human erythroleukemia cells.The second objective of this report is to elucidate wich molecule present in our extract can exert this effects. We found that berberine, the majoritory compound, can induce an apoptotic effect and inhibits the survival pathway of NF-\u0138B and p-AKT similarly to the extract.Key words: erythroleukemia, apoptosis, Berberis libanotica ,berberine, COX-2, NF-\u0138B, p-AKT","This work is part of the R&D program aimed for a CMOS pixel sensor (CPS) complying with the requirements of the upgrade of the inner tracking system (ITS) of the ALICE experiment. In order break the limitations of the state-of-the-art CPS, a 0.18 \u00b5m quadruple-well CMOS process was explored. Besides an enhanced radiation tolerance, with respect to the former sensors fabricated in a 0.35 \u00b5m process, the sensor based on this new process allows for full CMOS capability inside the pixel without degradation of the detection efficiency. Therefore, the signal discrimination, which was formerly performed at the column level, can be integrated inside the pixel. As a result, the readout speed and power consumption can be greatly improved as compared to the CPS with column-level discrimination. This work addresses the feasibility study of achieving the signal discrimination withina small pixel (i.e. 22 \u00d7 33 \u00b5m2), via the prototype named AROM-0. The pixel of AROM-0 contains a sensing diode, a pre-amplifier and an offset compensated discriminator. The noise performance of the various pixel versions implemented in AROM-0 was evaluated. The study was further pursued with the AROM-1 prototypes, incorporating the optimized pixel designs and the necessary on-chip intelligence to approach the final sensor we have proposed for the ALICE-ITS upgrade. This thesis presents in detail the design and the measurement results of these AROM sensors.","My PhD thesis is integrated into a context of functional dimensioning development in a 3D CAD environment at Snecma, a major player in the aerospace propulsion world. The objectives of this research work are varied but follow one goal: mastery quality geometry throughout the design, control and manufacturing cycle, by the deployment of the ISO standards of tolerancing.At first a functional definition ISO is proposed for parts with complex shapes that make up a turbo-machine while considering issues related to metrology and automatic control without contact. This definition requires some updates of existing standards. Another problem was to meet industrial demands in their entirety by considering the various types of engine parts.A second important part of the work is to develop control and analyze tools for complex 3D shapes for a better understanding of their geometry by separating local and global faults, which do not have the same functional impact.A third part develops a 3D manufacturing transfer strategy on complex workpieces on mounting \u201c6 points\u201d by considering the surface orientation problems.All work ensures compliance of functional requirements, on parts with complex shapes, from definition to the workpiece through the deployment of ISO standards of tolerancing.This work led to a publication in CIRP CAT 2014 China, a Snecma internal development of a quantification tool of global \u002f local defects, a strong wich to develop a 3D transfer generic tool based on the work done, two awards Snecma creativity with one ranked second in 2013 on all the awards and a major change in the control method of form profiles specifications.","This PhD focuses on the study of the antimalarial activity of cepharanthine. Two green extraction methods, using microwave and ultrasound, have been proposed. The antiplasmodial activity was evaluated by calculating the concentration inhibiting 50 % of parasite growth. Potential targets were evaluated by studying the variation of gene expression. At the microscopic level, cepharanthine seemed to inhibit the parasite growth and to block parasite at the ring stages. The transcriptomic assay showed that cepharanthine seems to have an impact on the transport of Plasmodium proteins to the red blood cell surface, on organellar functions necessary for the survival of the parasite, and on the interactions between infected red blood cells and the endothelium or healthy red blood cells. The study of combination therapies showed that cepharanthine appears to potentiate some antimalarial compounds. A quantitative analysis of cepharathine in mouse plasma allowed performing a pharmacokinetic study. Cepharanthine could be an interesting lead to the development of new antimalarial drugs.","To study the principle of plant-insect co-evolution, we studied the interaction between a Poaceae, Zea mays, and the insect Spodoptera frugiperda. The Poaceae developed the DIMBOA-biosynthetic pathway, compound with bactericide, fungicide and insecticide effects. Noctuid moths like S. Frugiperda, a maize pest, had to coevolve when the pathway expanded. We studied the origin of the DIMBOA-biosynthetic pathway in Poaceae by a bioinformatic approach and demonstrated that the origin of the pathway was the rearrangement of two new duplicated genes, Bx1 and Bx2, at the tip of a chromosome of a poaceous ancestor. Bx2 was further duplicated, leading to the 4 P450s of the pathway which further evolved by functional divergence and\u002for positive selection processes, explaining their actual high substrate specificity. We also characterized maize lines for which the pathway was blocked in the Bx1 and Bx3 genes by metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches and demonstrated that they could be used to simulate disappeared evolutionary ancestral steps. We then compared the influence of the ingestion of wild type or Bx1 and Bx3 mutant plants on S. Frugiperda larvae by a toxicological study and a transcriptomic approach. Finally, we studied the toxicological impact of different pathway intermediates on insect larvae. Our results demonstrate that, during coevolution, the polyphagous insect S. Frugiperda has optimized its response to the entire pathway and is no longer adapted to ancestral steps of the pathway and DIMBOA precursors. This observation allows us to envisage the manipulation of a maize constitutive defense as a way to fight against one of its main pest.","The work reported in this thesis has been developed at the interface between three disciplines, i.e., electrochemistry, material science and microbiology. The purpose of this research was first to study the activity of bacteria immobilized in silica-based films prepared by the sol-gel process on electrode surfaces. Potential applications concern biosensors, bioreactors and biofuel cells. Electrochemically assisted bacterial encapsulation has been developed, using sol electrolysis to immobilize Escherichia coli in a hybrid sol-gel layer. The combination of silica precursors, chitosan, poly(ethylene glycol) and trehalose allowed preservation of cell membrane integrity and metabolic activity. Electrochemistry was then considered as an analytical method. Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas fluorescens have been encapsulated in silica-based films and the electron transfer reactions from bacteria to different redox mediators have been monitored. Single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with ferrocene moieties and bovine heart cytochrome c have been considered as redox shuttles to facilitate the electron transfer in the non-conducting silica matrix, leading to the elaboration of artificial biofilms. Interestingly, these two classes of mediator, i.e. chemical and biological, led to different substrate sensitivity because of their different mechanism of interaction with the bacteria. Immobilization of membrane associated redox proteins in sol-gel films have been then considered and applied for electrocatalysis. Direct and mediated electrochemical communication has been investigated between the electrode surface and cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2) or mandelate dehydrogenase, respectively, showing the interest of sol-gel to stabilize the bioelectrocatalytic reaction. Finally, the influence of encapsulation in a hybrid sol-gel matrix on the infectivity of bacteriophage [phi]X174 has been studied and the protective effect of polyethyleneimine or glycerol was shown","The ability to control the propagation of acoustic waves knows in recent years potential applications especially on the manufacture of electrical filter, but also in controlling the mechanical vibration of structures and sound insulation. To achieve this control, the properties of propagations can be changed by external load. The aim of this work is to achieve the control of acoustic waves in phononic crystal using piezoelectric materials. These materials have elastic properties coupled to the electrical properties resulting from their manufacturing process. The vibration of a piezoelectric layer is affected by the electrical boundary conditions imposed on its electrodes. A simple way to consider an electrical boundary condition on piezoelectrical material is to connect an external impedance load (positive capacitance, negative capacitance, inductance) to its electrodes. The resonance frequencies of the piezoelectric layer are then affected differently according the nature of external electric load. The positive capacitance allows to reduce the parallel resonance frequency. A negative capacitance makes it possible to increase the parallel resonance frequency of the piezoelectric layer, giving the ability to use the piezoelectric material away from away from its fundamental resonance frequency. The particular case of an inductive load has a wide possibility to control the propagation of acoustic waves through a piezoelectric pc. We demonstrate that the use of this inductive load opens a hybridization gap in a one-dimensional piezoelectric structure and enable to control the frequency position of this gap. As a result, the hybridization gap causes the opening of a bandwidth within the gap Bragg. The hybridization gap can also cause a high attenuation of acoustic waves in a pass band especially at low frequencies.","The advent of sensitive interfaces is promising prospects to the human-machine interaction. We propose a new concept of sensitive flexible surface. Its aim is to study the interaction between electrical signal and resistive and dielectric environment of the support in order to realize an acquisition system providing machine readable information.The technological base is a waveguide on flexible substrate on which the touch creates a reflection at the input port. We have developed a location method as an alternative to the time domain reflectometry (TDR). It is named Harmonic Detection and Location (HDL) and it allows using a narrow band, around 100 MHz, low complexity acquisition system. The concept has been approved using measures on flexible and rigid sensitive surfaces connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA) used as reference. A compact acquisition system based on a Wheatstone bridge associated to a phase detector has been developed. For this purpose, errors characterization and identification work has been done.  Electromagnetic interactions between the finger and the waveguide, waveguide imperfections, substrate nature and acquisition system errors\u2019 impact have been studied. This knowledge has provided the possibility to co-develop the hardware and the detection algorithm to demonstrate a location accuracy of 2cm. Fundamental principles of this work provide the possibility of realizing large surface interfaces, with simple connection and conformable, for 3D sensitive objects.","This thesis has focused on the construction of strain energy densities for describing the non-linear behavior of anisotropic materials such as biological soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, arterial walls, etc.) or fiber-reinforced rubbers. The densities we have proposed have been developed with the mathematical theory of invariant polynomials, particularly the Noether theorem and the Reynolds operator. Our work involved two types of anisotropic materials, the first with a single fiber family and the second with a four-fiber family. The concept of polyconvexity has also been studied because it is well known that it plays an important role for ensuring the existence of solutions. In the case of a single fiber family, we have demonstrated that it is impossible for a polynomial density of any degree to predict shear tests with a loading parallel and then perpendicular to the direction of the fibers. A linear polynomial density combined with a power-law function allowed to overcome this problem. In the case of a material made of a four-fiber family, a polynomial density allowed to correctly predict bi-axial tensile test data extracted from the literature. The two proposed densities were implemented in C++ language in the university finite element software FER by adopting a total Lagrangian formulation. This implementation has been validated by comparisons with reference analytical solutions exhibited in the case of simple loads leading to homogeneous deformations. More complex three-dimensional examples, involving non-homogeneous deformations, have also been studied.","Predicting biodiversity responses to anthropogenic climate change has become a field of research with major scientific and societal issues. The main goal of my thesis was to evaluate the impacts of global warming on a Drosophila parasitoid, Leptopilina boulardi, at a small geographical scale, the South-East of France. The aim was not only to examine the change in the distribution of the parasitoid in response to rising temperatures, but also to understand the adaptations associated with this change. First, the analysis of insect sampling and meteorological data allowed me to demonstrate a rapid expansion of the parasitoid range to the north with an average rate of 90km\u002fdecade as well as a simultaneous temperature increase of 1.57\u00b0C on average over the past 30 years in the studied area. Following the identification of the main environmental factors structuring the spatial distribution of L. boulardi, I fitted a model predicting its potential distribution in the south-east of France, under the current climate and in 2050, for two CO2 emission scenarios. In 2050, the geographical distribution of L. boulardi should significantly extend northward as a result of climate change. Then, by measuring several life history traits under four fluctuating temperature regimes, I have shown that populations of L. boulardi located on the border of the range are genetically differentiated from those in the central range. The fact that marginal populations have a greater fitness at low temperature suggests local adaptation of parasitoids in the area of progression of range. The last part of this thesis aimed to better understand the process of colonization of L. boulardi. For this, I undertook the development of RAD-sequencing markers to genotype 15 populations of this species distributed along a cline of latitude in the southeast of France. Numerous data from Illumina sequencing will allow me to characterize the genetic structure of the populations. All the results obtained in my thesis highlight the force with which climate change may impact species, in particular those of high trophic level, causing rapid changes in distribution along with genotypic and phenotypic changes underlying local adaptation","Study and synthesis of new NHC-Boranes usable as hypergolic fuels and as photo co-initiators for radical emulsion photopolymerizationsThe first N-Heterocyclic Carbene Borane complex (NHC-Borane) was synthetized in 1993, but we had to wait until the mid-2000s before chemists investigated their properties and reactivity. The applications of NHC-Boranes range from organic chemistry (where they are used as reducing agents or for the hydroboration of multiple bonds) to radical chemistry (as replacement of te tributyltin hydride) and radical polymerizations (initiators and co-initiators). We designed and synthetized new Nitrogen-rich NHC-Boranes. The latter are hypergolic and might serve as fuels for solid propulsion. We managed to synthetize several new classed of NHC-Borane which was or could be used in different fields. We also deepened our understanding of the visible light-induced emulsion polymerization, where the NHC-Boranes serve as co-initiators. We could optimize the process and then replaced the surfactant by an inorganic sol to propose the first Pickering emulsion photopolymerization. Stable latexes of hybrid particles have been generated which might be used as sunscreen films, to reduce the energetic footprint of the reactions and\u002for to access particles made of heat- or UV-sensitive materials","Increasing performance demands in advanced technology, together with limited energy budgets, force integrate circuit designers to think about new ways of saving power.One innovative way of doing so is presented in this work. The newly developed Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) scheme tunes the supply voltage of digital circuits according to the present Process, Voltage and Temperature variations as well as Aging (PVTA). The key components of the proposed approach are in-situ delay monitors, detecting late but still non-erroneous signal transitions (pre-errors). Based on the measured pre-error rate, the voltage is adjusted with a low-overhead control unit connected to the on-chip voltage regulator. This way power consumption is optimized, by exploiting unused timing margin, produced by state-of-the-art worst-case designs.This work has been done in STMicroelectronics and has been developed over four chapters in order to integrate reliability progressively from devices to digital circuits: in the first chapter we are interested in technological developments that have been necessary from standard CMOS technologies (40LP, 28LP) to FDSOI technology for 28nm node as well as monotonic degradation mechanisms such as BTI and HCI. Then, the impact of these degradation mechanisms along with PVT on data-path timing is discussed. The second chapter summarizes the state-of-arts of in-situ monitors and shows the characterization results of three kinds of pre-error in-situ monitors. The third chapter looks first at the integration of in-situ monitor in the digital implementation flow. As a second step, a potential critical path selection algorithm is developed. This algorithm is based on sub-critical paths identified by Static Timing Analysis (STA) before and after aging. The fourth chapter exhibits the experimental results of digital circuits that contain in-situ monitors. These circuits are designed in 45nm, 28LP and 28FDSOI technology and tested under different PVTs along with workload conditions. The results demonstrate the robustness of in-situ monitor to cope with different kinds of variations. Also, the behavior of in-monitor using AVS scheme is shown.","Chondrichthyes are species of interest because of their phylogenetic position at the base of the Vertebrates. In this thesis, based on a small shark, the small spotted dogfish, the study of Nanos proteins, essential for the maintenance of the germ line in Osteichthyes, showed the presence of two Nanos1 proteins (1A and 1B) in Chondrichthyes, resulting from a gene duplication upstream of the Gnathostomata. Each paralog revealed specific expression profiles suggesting a gene specification. In addition, the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) niche was better characterized and new pluripotency markers such as SSEA4 and Sox2 were detected in potential SSCs in this species. A primary culture of the germinative zone enriched in spermatogonia showed a heterogeneity of expression of the analysed SSC factors (GFR\u03b11, SSEA4, POU2, Nanos1A, Nanos1B, c-Kit), suggesting heterogeneity of stem cells and \u002f or progenitors. In order to validate the stemness potential of these cells in culture, a functional transplantation test was initiated. The development of this technology, for the first time in a Chondrichthyes, opens new perspectives in terms of preservation of these species. Finally, the search of potential therapeutic factors in the dogfish testis led to the identification of a peptide able to regulate blood glucose and insulin levels in mice presenting type 2 diabetes, but its mode of action remains to be explored. All the results confirm the interest of the small spotted dogfish for the evolutionary study of the germinal niche, essential to the maintenance of gametogenesis, and the search for molecules with therapeutic potential.","TMI-Orion, a company specialising in systems for acquiring physical parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity, etc.) for harsh environments, wishes to diversify, particularly in the civilian nuclear markets or the new space. These two markets are subject to strong radiative stress. The company, which is at the origin of the thesis, wishes to develop its skills with regard to radiative stress in order to be able to propose applications in these sectors. This thesis was therefore conducted with the main objective of providing as much information as possible on radiative stress to TMI-Orion. We have therefore identified four areas of work to address this issue.In the context of this thesis, we began by describing the radiative environments encountered in the space and civilian nuclear fields. Then the mechanisms of radiation-matter interaction were defined. Finally, the effects of radiation on electronics have been given.The second area of work consists of a study of the degradation mechanisms of elementary electronic components (MOS and bipolar transistors) as a function of the temperature to which they are subjected during irradiation. The effect of low (up to 100 K) and high (up to 400 K) irradiation temperatures on the degradation of elementary components was studied. During this study we were also able to compare the degradation obtained between a cobalt-60 irradiation and an X-ray irradiation.The third area of work consists of a simulation study on shielding against radiative stress. As part of this work, we have developed two calculation codes on GEANT4. The first one allows to study the dose deposited by a cobalt-60 source for different shielding conditions. The second one allows to model the X-ray generator of the IES laboratory and gives its energy spectrum. The effect of different filters on the spectrum is also studied.The last axis of this thesis work consists of a complete reliability study on autonomous data loggers developed by TMI-Orion. One particular recorder, the PicoVACQ, is used as an example. The reliability of this recorder was calculated by an analytical method, studied using the feedback available within the company, measured against thermal stress and measured against radiative stress. Finally, the search for a microcontroller, a central component of a radiation-tolerant data acquisition system, was carried out. One microcontroller in particular appears to have good resistance to dose effect and will probably be used by the company in its future projects.","Community life gives many advantages, but also disadvantages with which animal must accommodate. In order to maintain social cohesion, group members must therefore make compromise and resolve quickly conflicts of interest. Understanding how individuals reach common and optimal decisions helps to learn more about the social organization, movement patterns and habitat use of the species. In return, this information is essential to the development of new management strategies. In this context, I was interested in group life and collective movements of the European bison, species which experiencing its great come back on its continent of origin. My works have shown that (1) matrilineal ties were at the core of the species\u2019 social life, (2) the European bison, contrary to popular opinion, was far from a strictly forest animal and (3) group movements were preferentially lead by the oldest dominant females which had a calf. Taking into account these results could be greatly improve the reintroduction and management of bison populations and, thereby, allow a better cohabitation with humans.","Despite national an international efforts, malaria remains a major public health in manycountries and sanitary systems are hindered by the lack of information on the actual burden ofmalaria, on the plasmodium transmission risk and on their geographical distribution.Nevertheless, spatial heterogeneity can be important and in this context, malaria control couldbe improved if could be focused in place and time. On one hand, the environment is a majordeterminant of malaria biodiversity, because of the vectorial transmission and the vectorsbioecological preferences. On another hand, orbiting satellites can provide environmental,climatic and meteorological data that already have been used for the study of infectiousdiseases. \u201cTele-epidemiology\u201d has been defined as an integrated approach aiming atassociating medical, epidemiological or entomological ground data, with remotely-sensedenvironmental data, based on the in depth comprehension and measurement of the involvedphysical and biological mechanisms. In cities, it has already been possible to highlightassociations between mapped urban settings and malariometric indices, using satellite data atappropriate scales. Among travellers, in the objective to evaluate malaria risk or efficacy ofprophylactic devices, it would be useful to evaluate and predict transmission levels in thevisited places. The objective of the present thesis was to identify environmental factors thatcould be remotely-sensed and that could be used in the evaluation of malaria risk amongtravellers on one hand and in urban settings on the other hand.First, remotely-sensed data have been used to evaluate levels of exposure to malaria risk ofmilitaries, in the scope of a study on their risk factors for clinical malaria. Results haveshowed that, even when taking into account age and compliance to chemoprophylaxis asconfusion factors, the environment was the factor the most strongly associated to clinicalmalaria risk.In parallel, an extensive entomological study has been conducted during five years in Dakarand allowed demonstrating a strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity of malariatransmission in the city. Collected information were centralized in a georeferenced database(GIS - Geographic Information System) containing all entomological, environmental,meteorological, biological and physical data collected on the field or by remote sensing.Finally, modelling of entomological risk in the capital city of Senegal was undertaken, basedon data collected on the ground and environmental data issued from satellites. A first stepshowed the evolution of malaria transmission risk areas and allowed declaring that thefraction of human population that was at high risk for transmission decreased between 1996and 2007. A second step led to the development of 1) a map of the breeding sites with aproductivity indicator in Dakar city, 2) a map of aggressive adult Anopheles densities, and 3)a dynamic aspect was added to those maps, taking into account the variations of theirmeteorological determinants.The results of the work undertaken in this thesis demonstrated that remotely-sensedinformation, associated with a large amount of ground data, allow to adjust predictive models and to draw entomological risk maps, in urban settings or for moving populations","The works presented in this thesis explore the non-linearity and non-stationarity aspects of the hydroclimate system in France and the Euro-Atlantique area. In part I, \u00abSpatio-temporal scales of hydroclimate variability in France\u00bb, classifications of precipitation, temperature and discharge time series of 152 watersheds were established, based on non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. In particular, we based our classifications on spectral contents and cross-scale, phase-phase, phase-amplitude interactions. Results show clear homogeneous regions for each variable, but with complex spectral content and cross-scale interactions. Part II, \u00ab Spatiotemporal of local and large-scale climate variability\u00bb, we studied how the watershed modulation altered the spectral correlation between local climate (precipitation, temperature) and discharge. We then studied the large-scale atmospheric patterns linked to discharge, with a combined spatial and temporal spectral analysis. Results show than temperature is the main driver of discharge at the annual scale, but precipitation is the main driver for other time scales. The large scale atmospheric patterns linked to discharge were shown to be time scale dependent and heavily modulated from West to east, with interacting atmospheric components shifting the main time scales of spectral correlation with discharge.  Finally, Part III \u00ab North Atlantic atmospheric circulation dynamics\u00bb, introduces a new conjecture linking the geometrical theory of the extremal length (a conformal invariant) and conservative atomspheric systems, such as the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation. We have shown that the time invariance of the extremal length implies conservation in mechanical energy within the atmospheric system, and that the increase\u002fdecrease of invariance induces mechanical energy losses\u002fgains. The application of the theory to the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation, shows that depending on the time scale, the dynamics are vastly different, ranging for asymptotically stable to unstable, and that the atmospheric circulation for the last 40 years has seen large changes in its dynamics. Through this thesis, we showed the importance of time scale dependence, interactions between them, and more generally, of non-linearity and non-stationarity. We encourage hydrologist and climate scientists to adopt a combined physics-statistical approach in order to better grasp the complexity of hydroclimate systems.","Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common hereditary disease with an autosomal dominant transmission resulting from gene haploinsufficiency. To evaluate the genetic basis of this complex disease, a vast collection of well-phenotyped ? families was collected through the NF-France Network. Genetic heterogeneity in NF1 was confirmed by (i) identification of patients with SPRED1 mutations and (ii) a sub; patients with no mutation in SPRED1 and NF1 (5% of XF1 patients). A more severe phenotype (facial dysmorphy and learning disabilities) was significantly confirmed in NF1 patients ' NF1 locus microdeletions (5% of NF1 patients) using a custom CGH array. Study of NF1 polymorphisms, analysis of intrafamilial correlations of 12 phenotypic traits, and phenotypes in the c families, allowed us to show that NF1 gene alleles were not implicated in disease variability but provided evidence f\u003c genetic modifiers, unlinked to the NF1 locus. To identify them, a gene candidate approach was used, targeting ANRJj large non coding ARN, located at CDKN2A\u002fB locus that was found deleted in plexiform neurofibromas. Family-base association analysis found a significant association between one SXP ofANRIL and the number of plexiform neurofibromas. These data report for the first time a modifier gene in NF1.","This phD thesis is part of the COSFLOS\u2019project. Its goal is to understand the galaxy structure evolution in the local universe. For this purpose, we make use of the Tully-Fisher relation in order to measure the distances for galaxies within 80 Mpc. My research area in the project is to collect, measure and analyze the data needed for the Luminosity LineWidth (LLW). This relation is a direct link between intrinsic luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its maximal gas rotation velocity. The best way to compute this velocity is to measure HI linewidth. Including my new observations and measurements, the current extragalactic database EDD contains 15 411 HI profiles. To obtain the apparent magnitude needed for the distances, I improve the ARCHANGEL software, implementing new displays. We took a great care to a special parameter : the inclination of observed galaxy. Finally, I present the Antlia cluster, one of the cluster I use to calibrate the slope of the LLW. I start with the candidates selection, then with observations to finally obtain the distances for the calibration","The resolution limit of gravitational wave interferometers is set by their mirrors' Brownian motion \u2013 or thermal noise - in the central part of their detection band, from 10Hz to 1kHz. This thermal noise frequency distribution is given by the mechanical energy dissipation mechanisms it originates from, in agreement with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This dissipation mainly derives from the optical coatings deposited on the mirrors to give them their reflectivity. To reduce this thermal noise, a new generation of gravitational wave detectors employing mirrors cooled to cryogenic temperature has been suggested. The development of new optical thin-film materials with low mechanical dissipation, operating at both room and cryogenic temperatures, therefore requires new experimental tools. The main object of this thesis is the construction of a new instrument, the CryoQPDI, which is an association between a high-resolution interferometer and a cryostat based on a pulse tube cooler. It can directly measure the Brownian motion of a microcantilever between 300 K and 7 K. By combining measurements made on a microcantilever before and after the deposition of a thin film, it is possible to characterize the internal mechanical dissipation of this thin film. This instrument will eventually contribute to the optimisation of optical coatings of future gravitational wave detectors, aiming at minimizing the limitations due to thermal noise","The traditional methodology of nuclear data evaluation, which has been in use for the past four decades, is showing its limitations in reducing signi\ufb01cantly the uncertainties in neutron cross sections below their current level. This suggests that a new approach should be considered. This PhD work aims at demonstrating that a major qualitative improvement is possible by changing the reference frame historically used for evaluating nuclear data model. The central idea was to move from restrictive frame of the incident neutron and target nucleus to the more general frame of the excited compound system. Such a change, which implies the simultaneous modelling of all the reactions leading to the same compound system, opens up the possibility of direct comparison between nuclear model parameters, whether those are derived for reactor physics applications for reactor physics applications, astrophysics or basic nuclear spectroscopy studies. This have the double advantage of bringing together evaluation activities performed separately, and of pooling experimental databases and basic theoretical nuclear parameter \ufb01les. During this PhD thesis, a new module, so called TORA (TOol for Reactions Analysis), was implemented within the CONRAD system of the CEA\u002fLEPh, to allow the change of paradigm foreseen for next generation of evaluated neutron cross sections.","This thesis is dedicated to the study of the ballistic behaviour of woven material using a microscopic approach based on the numerical homogenization technique. Indeed, during a ballistic loading, the projectile acts locally on the impact zone of the fabric, thus generating a transverse compression of the fibres. This phenomenon has been modelled, at the fibre scale, taking into account the effects of fibre-fibre interactions and the evolution of the volume fraction of yarn during loading. From this modelling, a non-linear mechanical behaviour law describing the evolution of apparent stress and strain in a yarn subjected to transverse compression was obtained. Then, based on a periodic Representative Volume Element (RVE), a numerical homogenization technique taking into account the void between fibres was used for modelling. A power law between the apparent deformation and the volume fraction for a yarn subjected to transverse compression was deduced based on this approach. These data were implemented into a model in order to analyse the microscopic behaviour of fibres subjected to ballistic impact based on a multi-scale approach. The analysis has provided a better prediction of the physical phenomena occurring during the ballistic impact of one single yarn at the fibre scale. Then, this model was applied to the case of one fabric subjected to ballistic impact at a mesoscopic scale (yarn scale) combined with a microscopic scale (fibre scale) in the impact zone. This model was validated by comparison with experimental data, in terms of the evolution of projectile velocity. The evolution of energy, impact force, fibre-fibre interactions and local fibre failure are also analysed.","Interacting processes and random environments are the main focus of this thesis, which consists of three different works. First, we study a conjecture of Erschler, Toth and Werner about a model of interacting random walks on the integer line, called Stuck Walks, for which there is competition between repulsion from the neighbouring edges and attraction from the next-to-neighbouring edges. We prove that these walks localize on arbitrarily large intervals, the size of which depends on the value of some parameter. Second, we present a joint work with A. Fribergh in which we study some random walks in random environments. It is already known that such walks can be directionally transient without being ballistic, because of traps slowing down the walker. In this article, we aim to show that typical traps are unit hypercubes. We prove an ellipticity criterion which implies ballisticity of random walks in random environments that are directionally transient. This criterion deals with the expected exit time of a unit hypercube. We also show that if the annealed expected exit time of a unit hypercube is infinite then the walk has zero asymptotic velocity. Finally, in a joint work with P. Tarres, we propose a model of social network formation based on reinforcement learning. We prove that the expected rate of communication increases in average and thus converges almost surely, and that a limit graph emerges. We show that stable configurations for this graph consist of star-shaped connected components with uniform weights. Conversely, any graph correspondence with the preceding property, and within which every vertex is connected to at least another one, is a limit configuration with positive probability."],"marker":{"opacity":0.5,"size":5},"mode":"markers+text","name":"0_the_of_and","text":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"textfont":{"size":12},"x":{"dtype":"f4","bdata":"7bx9QLqYCj\u002fDO78+jwclQPH8Yz7o2CNANUHXP6Ku7z8gGOQ\u002fhxHGPxAAoj4a2Aw\u002fcUxwQKSICL4k+do\u002fvnEeQLBE7D7XkixAXh9WQL89GUAK2Hk++vQEQGQfGb43Jag\u002fwhJhQH54N0Ag2yZA8cyzP2ViMUDBgQ9AQtFBP23x9j9+SjVAIKxAP\u002f8lrz\u002fnsn1AKBlcQFaGJUByHZA\u002fLmB0QEQWFECp9tQ\u002fAqTFP1alKUA12CtArELuPxDLGkBPfzhAT7PpPyVHdEDZ2ypAZwaAP0ASzz9eDEBAMYDiP4WYa0CV764\u002fi2QbQCzltz9dLCpAgcFBQC4JQUA4NwdAeG\u002fNP+SGij4pTEJA5ao9QI5wIUDqF84\u002ffpgsQPFRaT8pc6k\u002fwdb7PwNJdz\u002fHnQ8\u002fv8jTP4JuPEDz6hNAcswRQDw2h0DT7GJAcVMbQMQ4GkA5iMc\u002f1tNIQNkDAEBfJDNAIVUjPnEt4j8ELeg\u002fC5ceQFSKe0AUSxxAu4EhQFwAOkDzY+Y+7vxJQMhA6z1xfWw\u002fYDiyP+GRtD9w0YJABGNfPw3cJz+w7AlAHE8FQDtDAkCn3+Y9yRBFP0yL0T8SSak\u002fTDDWP8Z5D0DLBZU+0\u002fSbPw4CL0CTtdk\u002fNjUZQBqSHEA3gIs+DqwjQHc9J75BA\u002fQ\u002f8yQBQClVcD9NayU\u002fzXykPhMvNECuKZQ\u002fpjXQP0DTGj9VwxO8PWv2PxHGHUBsAyg+tqlEQH+kzz96UhdArVcdQHvAFEB8a\u002fQ\u002fSq5aPC4rmD9AdnQ\u002ftVjWPR2eOEBDM3Q\u002fKyjwP3d4QL4IM2c\u002f0fQhQF2AA0A69DtAewFBQEqwREDdaRtAbnlsQLhQVUAt\u002fgk\u002fBLQxQEIDRkAD39Q\u002fsicHQI3GC0DHXjZAAbClP+AezT94LztAYjolQCTZRECV8q0\u002fSrhWP97PQEAQek5AyGpyQI5SzD9bJ3BAj9FnQLi25z9vwxZAh\u002fYYQIAZFkB21zQ+Sj4pQNeewz6wbgtAC1U1QPw65D\u002flPc28gMv3P7kxRj9\u002f0jNATE3JP2fcAUDHDA2+aCSbP2+8FkB6MKM+kv3\u002fP51PVUDL\u002fkM\u002fE1iCP7X58z8OfyhAPkToPln\u002fxj+ZiOI\u002f37XqP\u002fPU770zssC9pX53P+85T0ANLG5AIwRDP8mTdUAyGRY\u002fiqsVQA+LwD4E7gBA5vGOP0omekB\u002fOSO+5G6RP405rz9pAwU\u002fQGwPQDaJQkD1O9g\u002fBM3tPw0BFkDH0wFA4tpAP7Mbuj81jlI\u002fLNwyQFX3lz52c+c8hai9P7LvEUDJbl1ARpNDQP2rEj\u002fjnTxAlSoRQDFcNz98Rvg\u002f9XVRQKtJ6z9wIpU+SOCUP75f1D8FLto\u002f+R+DvF5yyD\u002fHCxw\u002fEi0HvkKbc0DAA0JAnXsbQA03tD94sBxAZB+YPwXE+z\u002fG9xlAyZIgQFZ4TEDDp60\u002fhMzqPw841D9+w8s\u002fjY1fP\u002f6DzD9ECR1AZbohQNIrAUDEUqA+XIvhPzE+akDzCklAg1wpvrHKZEBTGlxAfXgfP5K5bz9UMkpAvQjtP4DSAEADygdADYryP9dEBT6dZeY\u002fkuMqQCtDFkDwulQ\u002fAOKMP6MR8D+BwyFAHqt6P6ccDD4IkJE\u002fq++YP\u002fFx2D9oisY\u002f56cRQCLsT0BsYCJAHESgPt8IzT\u002fBCBdASq8mQP4EXkBlQcc\u002f1j0RQOCRF0BJ+VBAQzRdP79Zxz9NoaU\u002f3eAqQK9rhUDvKUA\u002fo8jRvVQKCr6IAjNAJ8ZpP+UGdj\u002fUaj5A0uktPnWvGEBdPFg\u002fzXjnP2qjFUA+jIZAj3rDPwrnC0BFaeo\u002fwoMFQGxLMEDtg1E+7H4gQDbnL0DuTOE+quxzQGMzwT682NI\u002fk\u002frLPxkhjj1wC4VAH9d6PlBB371V+EBAjpQRQPZPMUBMj7M\u002flAFRQNgvUEA78aE+eCa\u002fPu\u002fTpz81u8Y\u002fd9oPQAMaMj83YPo\u002fUUbHPy9wRD4aoRVAGvHTPwO14j\u002fo1UtAHXY6QAPXJUDbJfE\u002fxu0mP0esMj9slYk\u002fGt1CQM+FYD2QGQ9AjyobQAD8wD\u002fMyT9AOvREQGhtH0BK1\u002f0\u002fmAH3P2KXfz\u002fJdbg\u002fDcSZP4j8XkA="},"y":{"dtype":"f4","bdata":"pWLGQPAQuUDTELVAmmm2P1\u002ftf0ACed1AWIDyPx\u002fcM0AJsKBAJFjZQNXza0AnuJlAk9W9QBefiEARe6pAC7zLQByLZEDfK1RAs37EQMADR0D\u002fpLlAQmnZP0p9oECmJ6ZACXrSQKygw0AY1ZZAATeMQMkFRkCGJc4\u002fM3qXQNL3B0B+YZg\u002feNSAQC2ljkASEMpAIqrTQKKCT0CVZ99A9P3ZQMgL6kB+bNZAbfiAQM77pT9BH6E\u002fTw8VQJTzqT9vP75AbxXLQMfP2UB7suZAuGjFQHhmekCh2C5A\u002fRY7QN0bykA1khtA++3oQLhbpECbd+hAsKGDQKXkvkBAVbtA+K4ZQGZJqUAcj\u002fJARTLpQM5OWkBjxQtAZrXMQOIh3kCHj9JAjRzhP4R0qkBxIaJAPXj1PyipNUDb2eFAcuRBQKkVwkBaTshA0Nm0P4tF50DytHJAbfUyQFAYGUAgWZBA3cifQB1rgECN3p1AOEihP33lxEC2c1dAvek2QJesgUDcWolARCvBQMFNo0AT\u002fs9Ah6uOQEdQGEAfl79AXXCeQPNXxkABENFAwMK0QA3N4z+8VbFAlBPZQEj6\u002fD\u002fzxJlAuUF8QAoI2T\u002fR7nRAmfKRQPqxnz9M4zZA8STAP+6uRUBPEmpAax6WQCcjiUC+y1lAVj\u002fQP5PdnkDLK7tAMfK0QOBu8kAvbD9A90l2QAKnm0Cp445AYz7IQCy67j+IGoBAM642QDCTlUBwCCZAdEc+QAWCoEBFKjVAH5+nQBdfg0Cld3lAeIKpQH8bXEAdJ99As2cOQC3BokAFt91AWrWsP57azECmYe1AWOXyQCxI8kDx1bA\u002f7be2QD5mxEC0eJ1AJwAMQCO86UBjU3NAYvezQOqf40DXXQRAq5ONQKX4p0AYQC1AgjKhPwYWMEBU48dAFyDbQLN98kB4qehA86+6QNqZc0DEQ71Aywy\u002fQMg6PUCAoqRAGJufQNTw5UAP0Y9ANxwvQFKIYkCgyqZAqh2UP4vuz0CaYKBApgjEPwexuUCOWI9A4CWgQE3ltEDJtJRAUME9QDCK3j95HLVAuAKlQBKgx0AANNNAqRvUQI4d

thesis, which is a descriptive study, covers several French writers, mainly travelers, who write on different themes about the Eastern Mediterranean - Turkey, Syria, Egypt and the Holy Land - during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In order to have a vision encompassing all aspects of human life in this region during these two centuries, we have selected a sample of 24 authors, representing various areas of knowledge: diplomats, merchants, religious adventurers. The works of these authors provide information on various topics of the eastern Mediterranean: the organization of different nations, religions, social life, and cities, economic, administrative, political and scientific fields. The study of these works allows us to highlight two major elements. On the one hand we discover how French readers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have learned about this geographical area. On the other hand we have a vision of this space through the eyes of contemporary French authors. Three points are discussed in this thesis starting from the analysis of these works: the methods used by the authors in writing their accounts, the conditions in which these works were produced, and finally the content of these last with the study of the various topics covered by these authors. For each of these three points, the focus is on the differences between the authors of the seventeenth and eighteenth century ones, allowing the detection of changes experienced by their writings a century the other in how to deal with the themes of the Eastern Mediterranean.","This study aims to analyse the general outlines of the problems that contemporary Turkish society is faced with on the road to democratisation. Turkey has, for some time, been going through an intense and continuous transformation which carries great significance for the country itself and its place in international relations. The political regime which was placed in the 1920s and 30s and which had been strengthened with new measures after the Second World War has exhausted. The military coups and interventions which had occurred several times in intervals since the 1960s have caused more complexities rather than solving the deep-rooted problems of the country. Measures to save and prolong this repressive, authoritarian and anti-democratic regime are hardly working. It is becoming clear that this regime is unable to respond to the aspirations of the people and the youth, nor is it fit for the requirements of Turkey\u2019s international relations or for the demands of the national and international capital. Some of the pressing questions of Turkey, i. E. The national (Kurdish) question, laicism, fundamental democratic freedoms, etc. Have been accumulating since the foundation of the Republic. Coupled with the problems caused by the dictatorial governments and the power struggles of the last few decades, it becomes evident how entangled the situation in the country is. Democracy can only become settled on the basis of individual and collective social actors. Political parties and currents, the main subject of this study, are in this sense the unalienable elements of a democratic system. Therefore, the study of the important events that took place in Turkey in this long period in question and the development of the main political parties and currents which had determining inputs in these events will also bring to light the weaknesses in the functioning of the political system. 7 This study examines the formation, development, interruption and, in some cases, the return of the main political parties which are represented nationally. In this framework, it deals with issues such as the history of the multi-party system; social composition of the political parties, their relations with power; the role of the army as the saviour of the regime; the repercussions of the military coups that took place ever so often, interrupting the parliamentarian process; the past and the present of the Turkish aspiration of integration with Europe, and the positive and negative effects of the relations with the EU in terms of the democratic progress in Turkey","This thesis deals with the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security in the Sahel zone that we define as a region comprising 12 countries and 52 agroecological zones within these countries. The study area covers Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan and Chad. The situation in this part of the world is strongly impacted by climate change because agriculture, largely rainfed, plays an important economic role there. Climate change is then expected to have an impact on food production, which will make food availability and access even more difficult.From a theoretical point of view, this thesis aims to feed the literature on climate change and its effects on agricultural sectors in the world, particularly in the Sahel, by focusing on agroecological zones. From an empirical point of view and by using a range of statistical and econometric techniques, this thesis takes into account the agricultural and climatic characteristics of each country and agroecological zones of the Sahel.In the first chapter, we deal with the issue of climate change and variability based on precipitation and temperature during the different seasons of the countries and agroecological zones of the Sahel. Using a linear regression model and an endogenous structural change model, we show that countries and agroecological zones are indeed affected by climate change and that the year 1980 is an essential point in explaining this phenomenon for both scales. We also show that desert and arid areas suffered a large number of shocks from 1901 to 2016, with the exception of Nigeria, where wetlands and non-desert areas suffered several shocks.In the second chapter, we study the relationship between climate change and variability, measured by temperature and precipitation conditions in the rainy seasons, and agricultural production at country level and at the level of agroecological zones in the Sahel. Focusing on an agricultural production index and five cereals (corn, millet, sorghum, wheat and rice), we study this relationship using an original database with socio-economic and climate variables. On the basis of an estimated agricultural production function for the 1961-2016 period, we show that precipitation and average temperatures during the growing season have very heterogeneous effects on agricultural production according to the cereal and agricultural zone, depending specific needs and stress linked to the cereal and agronomic and climatic conditions of each zone.In the third chapter, we analyze the link between climate change and food security in the Sahel countries. Based on a multidimensional analysis of food security and a panel data model with delayed climate variables of interest, we show that drought and floods negatively affect food security. In the presence of these climatic disasters, floods cause more damage to food security. Socioeconomic factors also play an important role in food security. Our results show that the low level of economic development, population growth and inflation of food prices do not guarantee food security. In addition, the absence of conflicts and political stability are important levers for improving the food security situation of the populations.","During the seventh century, Syria and Mesopotamia came under the authority of the Medinese and then Umayyad caliphate. During this founding period for Islam, the society of the conquerors and their heirs was organised and structured into tribes, often Arabian immigrants, around the Arabic lingua franca. Yet, during the same time, regional and ethno-confessional churches got structured and centralised, especially the Syriacs of Miaphysite christology. They took off in the north of the two blocks of the former Roman Eastern Diocese, Syria, and the ex-Sasanian Iraq. This dissertation aims to determine the institutional mechanisms at work at the intersection of these two socio-cultural ecosystems \u2013Arab-Muslim and Syrian-Orthodox \u2013which resulted in the production of an hybrid but shared category: the Christian Arab tribes. I shall confront two types of sources, both essentially written and compiled under the Abbasids (after 132\u002f750): on the one hand those of the clerical networks about their specific bishoprics, the \u02bfamm\u0113(nations\u002ftribes) in the west, and the \u1e6cayy\u014dy\u0113(Arabs) in the east, and on the other the Muslim historical-legal literature dealing with the privileges of these na\u1e63\u0101r\u0101 al-\u02bfArab. Two ternary expressions refer respectively to the Tan\u016bk\u014dy\u0113(ar. Tan\u016b\u1e2b)\u02bfAq\u016bl\u014dy\u0113and \u1e6c\u016b\u02bf\u014dy\u0113of the \u01e7undof Qinnasr\u012bn and of the Ta\u0121lib, Iy\u0101d and al-Namir of theprovince of Mosul. They refer, however, to populations of Iraqi origin. They became Christianised and integratedinto both the caliphal and ecclesiastical order during the general process of northward migration along the two roads of Northern Mesopotamian (\u01e6az\u012bra), finally resulting in this bipolar distribution.","Since the Islamic Revolution (1979), through ideological domination and Islamisation, the educational system in Iran was set out to form a \"new man\". This thesis studies the attempts of the educational system during the past 34 years to establish and perpetuate ideological domination, and then analyzes the values transmitted by the curriculum through textbooks and schooling and defines the characteristics of this \"ideal man\".However, the resistance of students in school and youth in society shows that the educational system has been unable to form its \"ideal man\". Much resistance appears where the vulnerabilities in the dominant ideology arise. In addition, forming individuals in a society using a monotype model has been impossible during this period. Since the model is subjected to all the consequences of modernity and globalization. The opening of a window into other worlds, unofficial media, the Internet, satellite television channels, virtual social networks, diasporas and intellectuals have all played an important role in this resistance.But in the 21st century, in a society with a closed socio-political structure and generating alienating circumstances, the attempt to copy the model imposed by the dominant ideology can only lead to dichotomy. This study concludes that alienation in its various aspects appears as the consequence of a monotype model imposed on students by the dominant ideology. Thus, the educational system has contributed in the reproduction of general alienation in this society.","There are more and more constraints weighing on organizations, with more and more rules and procedures to respect. These constraints have a repercussion on employees, in particular through increased pressure and stress. The health sector has not been spared by this societal phenomenon and must face major challenges that lie ahead: contain increased health care costs, face technological and medical advances, deal with public pressure to improve the quality and security of health care and respond to a rising demand due to the ageing population.These challenges may give rise to absenteeism and turnover among caregivers. Absenteeism and turnover among nursing staff constitutes a major public health problem that is both costly and disrupting. Work carried out on absenteeism and departure intentions shows that complicated, intricate concepts are involved. Interpreting these behaviours through the concepts of organisational commitment, job satisfaction and role stressors allows one to grasp the complexity of these phenomena. Previous work done so far on role tensions has never jointly measured the three different forms of role tensions. In fact, the majority have concentrated on role conflict, to the detriment to the two other forms (role ambiguity and role overload). A simultaneous analysis of the three forms of role tensions, however, would be of great managerial interest as it would preferentially orientate management action on the form or forms of role tension which are the true explanatory factors in dependent variables. This would lead to better adaptation of the Human Resources Management practices and, in the end, boost their efficiency. This is the aim of our research. An exploratory qualitative study, supported by rigorous review of the literature, allowed us to construct research models that were tested in a quantitative study involving 300 nurses and around 30 health professionals. Our work contributes to shedding light on the determination of role tensions in the turnover phenomenon, or more precisely on the intent to leave of personnel, as well as job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Our findings are more disappointing in regard to absenteeism, which highlights the difficulty of its study and tends to confirm the complexity of this phenomenon.","This thesis examines the influence of professional identities on decision-making processes in defence policy, based on the study of military personnel in the Air Force. It analyses the profession of airman, a priori homogeneous, from an interactionist theoretical framework. This profession is crossed by competition phenomena between different segments that share a constructed identity, including the dominant one of pilots. Moreover, in view of the multiple bodies and specialties, the division of labor and its perception by the actors, the definition of a single professional identity is complex. However, common markers can be identified: relationships to militarism, to the environment, to weapon systems, etc. Secondly, the thesis relies on an institutionalist approach focused on the actors in order to achieve a double objective. First, to complete the demonstration with a conversion of the predefined variables and new components (norms, orientations and preferences of the actors). Second, to propose a multiscalar theoretical solution that links individual and collective actors in a public policy. Professional identity, considered as an explanatory variable \u201ctranscending\u201d (Scharpf) all others, becomes a factor influencing the decision-making processes of the actors. However, the weight of this identity variable depends on the context. Thus, while within the Air Force, pilots occupy most of the high responsibility positions, their influence seems to be diluted in the joint space.","Environmental policies, especially those using fiscal instruments, have become more and more important in a large number of countries over the last three decades. All OECD countries have introduced environmentally related taxes, and a growing number of them are carrying out a so-called \"green\" reform of their taxation. The use of the tax as an instrument for environmental policy has sparked wide debate among researchers on its impacts on economic growth, but without reaching consensus on the nature of these effects. Some find a negative effect; while others show a positive impact. Two points raised our attention on this subject. First, the empirical studies that verify the validity of these results are very rare. Second, the majority of theoretical models that have studied the effect of environmental taxation on economic growth assume that the government finances its expenditures solely through taxes and that the state budget is balanced each period, thus avoiding any burden associated to repayment of public debt. Therefore, this thesis aims firstly to explore empirically the nature of the relationship between environmental taxation and economic growth, and whether this relationship is sensitive to the level of other variables in the economy. We examine then the channels through which this tax can affect economic growth, and whether the existence and level of public debt can modify this effect.","The Framework Programs (FPs) are the European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) main tools for the promotion of research and innovation within the European territory. They both improve the competitiveness of European firms and promote the emergence of a European Research Area (ERA). Complex networks arise from the collaborations formed between the actors of research and innovation, through projects funded by the FPs. The objective of this thesis is first of all to show how network analysis provides an interesting perspective for a better understanding of FPs and then to assess the impact of innovation policies within the EU. This analysis will then enable an examination of the structural properties of collaborations formed under the FPs as well as a report on the determinants of collaborations within these programs. The work in this thesis focuses upon the Information Society Technology (IST) of the 6th FP. Two technological fields are used : Telecommunication and Electronics-Microelectronics.Initially, we study the networks formed by collaborations between two agents from selected technological fields and the aggregated network formed by these two fields of research. We study the general properties of these networks. We aim to verify whether or not these networks have the properties of \u201csmall-world networks\u201d. This type of network is known in the literature to foster innovation networks. We also observe the characteristics of their evolution over time. Then, we study the agents which compose the networks and particularly we highlight the existence of \u201chubs\u201d. We select the appropriate indicatorsand, where necessary, we develop new indicators as the strengthened degree for example. We conduct the analysis at both macroeconomic and microeconomic level. Finally, we construct networks which are aggregated at the regional level in order to study regional collaborations. Thus, it is possible to observe whether the FPs permit harmonious development within the EU and involve the construction of an ERA. In a second part, we study the determinants which may induce both agents to collaborate. We are particularly interested in agents who have experience in FPs. We study the role played by the traditional determinants as the means for R&D, geographical proximity,. In addition, we emphasize the role played by previous networks in collaboration choices. We study both the existence of collaboration between two agents and the intensity of these collaborations. Finally, in order to extend the analysis of the FPs, we study the formation of triads and particularly we show the existence of the phenomenon of \u201ctriadic closure\u201d.","This study examines the work of four North African writers : Assia Djebar, Tahar Ben Jelloun, Abdelwahab Meddeb and Boualem Sansal. It emphasizes the concept of literary voice in order to apprehend the conditions and theoretical background of vocal presence in the writings of these authors. By resorting to sociology of literature, this study connects the vocal aesthetics of texts to social and cultural experiences that might have affected the writers and led them to develop a sensitivity to sound. It analyses then the introduction and presence of voices in texts from a formal point of vue. It leans upon concepts of G\u00e9rard Genette\u2019s narratology, on Mikhail Bakhtine\u2019s analyses and criticism of vocality\u2019s contributions. It develops an attempt to distinguish orality and voice, as well as to understand how litterary construction of voice leads to various textual levels (dialogical, enunciative, narrative, stylistic, rhythmic). This study finally tries to understand the relationships between these four writers\u2019 poetics of voice, as well as the political and ethical meaning of voice in their writings. Leaning on Michel de Certeau and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s philosophical works, this study shows how literary voice involves ethical considerations about the world and the subject by examining the ways these writers speek about History and politics. This study tries to highlight that these four writers\u2019 poetics of voice can be understood if considered through a referencial as well as through a semiotic dimension.","After listing the examples of female saints used in the Proven cal and Alpine public paintings in the XVth century, this study notes limited sanctoral representations (Mary Magdalen, martyr virgins), the absence oflocal saints, and explores the consequences of these choices (polysemy of saintliness, visuallayout). The main corpus, made up of retables, mural paintings and exempla, is completed by hagiography, calendars and the commission contracts (prix-faits). There is a discrepancy between the fact that the figure of the female saint turns out to be limited in some media (painting, exempla), and with both the popularity of pilgrimages and the feminization of contemporary spirituality. This study looks into the common use of female saintliness and the visual conventions related to the central figure of Mary Magdalene and to the homogeneous group of martyr virgins that works out as a series. The visual function of the attribute, the fonns of identity, and the classifications are analysed. The figure of Saint Lucy, the specific mechanisms of the organ-attribute and the visual variations on the gender of the female saints bear witness to the suggestive inventivity of images, and lead to a redefinition of the polysemic notion of saintliness.","The role of the European Union, within the context of its support in the field of public health, consists of helping the Member States to achieve the goals defined in the multiannual framework program. Among these goals, telemedicine is a priority of eHealth. Telemedicine is a form of healthcare provided remotely using Information and Communication Technology(ICT). It aims to improve the efficiency of medical care systems faced with the ageing of the European population. This thesis is a study of cross-border telemedicine in the context of cross-border medical care as it is regulated by European Union law. However, the deployment of cross-border telemedicine depends on the competence of the Member States. A comparison between French and Czech legislation, in terms of the implementation of telemedicine in these Member States, reveals different strategies regarding the integration of telemedicine into their healthcare systems. In light of these two significant examples, it will be possible to show how the deployment of telemedicine in domestic law influences its cross-border development. European legislation encourages states to use cross-border telemedicine by identifying the challenges to be met and the actions to be taken in favour of its deployment, in the broader context of the development of new technologies. Telemedicine, as a practice using ICT, requires a modernization of the regulatory framework of the Member States, mainly in the areas of the responsibility of health professionals, the protection of quality and safety of telemedicine services, but also medical ethics. Despite strong support and encouragement of the European Union, the majority of Member States are deploying telemedicine very gradually. The most frequent barriers lie in funding and the lack of a legislative framework. Besides, telemedicine is a victim of the uberization phenomenon. Telemedicine services provided via mobile applications represent a great competition for clinical telemedicine and also unfair competition since these acts of tele-advice are not subject to the same strict regulation of medical care. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant positive impact on the practical deployment of telemedicine (clinical and uberized) and could ultimately have the effect of accelerating the effective development of cross-border telemedicine.","Anatomy is one of the most essential yet challenging subjects in medical education. It is introduced very early in the curriculum, and the student is required to retain this knowledge throughout their practice. One of the significant challenges faced in anatomy pedagogy is presenting complex three-dimensional body parts in classes. Multimedia methods such as animated videos and 3D anatomical models are popular to visualise the human body. But the issue of developing an easy to use software that enables teachers to create their own lessons without the need for design experts is ongoing. In this thesis, we present a Text-to-movie authoring system for anatomy professors. We provide the solution in three parts. We first present a formal language to describe all the visual elements in a video. This language is both human and machine-readable, and it allows us to annotate the video in text form. This Prose Storyboard Language (PSL) is developed for broader use in film direction and analysis. In the second part of the thesis, we present the anatomical specialisation of this language called the Anatomy Storyboard Language (ASL). This domain-specific language forms the basis of input for our authoring system. The users have to write scripts in ASL in which they list all the parts that they want to show in the video and outline the directions for the camera movements and animation of the elements seen. Our system reads the script, and the resulting animation is played in a Unity player. In the final part of the thesis, we present the results of our evaluation of the software done with four anatomy professors. The teachers could make their own narrated, animated video lessons on the knee and their limited experience in animation or video editing did not hold them back. The choice of text as an input was particularly favourable as the teachers did not have to learn a new and often intimidating user interface for design software, making our system intuitive and easy to learn.","The European social Charter is with the European Convention on Human Rights, one of both key treaties of the Council of Europe in human rights. It is the counterpart of the European Convention on Human Rights in the field of the business and social laws. She covers a wide range of rights relative to the accommodation, the health, the education, the employment, the legal and social protection, the movement of people and the nondiscrimination. The European social Charter, signed in 1961 and revised in 1996, backs up the social and economic rights of the man and establishes a system of control which guarantees their respect by States parts. This control can be made by reports, every other year, handed by States or by procedure of collective complaint in front of the European Committee of the securities, established by the Protocol of 1995. This Committee rules in right, law on the conformity of the national situations with the Charter. The justiciabilit\u00e9 of the European social Charter advances the problem of the opposability of the securities contained in the Charter. The securities are often considered as an obstacle to the economic profit in a globalized market. In number of countries the securities are put in tested severely because of the current economic crisis. It is necessary to continue to defend their legal effectiveness, legal value because the social Charter is called to play an essential role, allowing to prevent the social exclusion, to strengthen the social cohesion in Member States. Accordingly, the Charter is a tool in the service of the complete and long-lasting, sustainable development of our societies.","This thesis concerns the Husserlian description of the phenomenological constitution of the subject and of the world. We have tried to understand which are the peculiarities of this constitution, and therefore why we can say that a phenomenological constitution should not be confused with other descriptions of the constitution of the subject such as that of psychology. First we were interested in the question of the pure ego, trying to understand why at some point Husserl admits this notion, whereas in his early works he rejects it. This approach led us to study the notion of habits on Husserl. After returning to the debate started by Roman Ingarden on the problem of the constitution of the habitual properties of the ego, we have tried to sketch an analysis of habits which allows us to revisitby another way certain problems and advances which have appeared in the development of Husserlian thought. We will see how our interpretation of habits asserts it as a specifically phenomenological notion. We will see that this notion allows us to reinforce the thesis which affirms the evidence of a transcendental subject whereas showing that the latter is already constituted as a pole of his personal properties. We will also see how this interpretation is opposed to an objectivist description of nature and the world.","By the end of the 19th century, medicine overwhelmingly took hold of the homosexual phenomenon, basing itself on new findings related to psychopathology. Not only were characters physically identified thanks to a series of so-called scientific criteria, but they were also analysed through mental mapping. Although the aim of the classification of sexual behaviours was to cure rather than punish, the practices of sexual minorities were still stigmatized. As far as the judiciary system was concerned, French laws were considered to be quite lenient in so far as homosexual relationships had no longer been regarded as offences since the 1810 penal code. Nevertheless, the distorted use of the affront to public decency enabled to control people's behaviours and, by the end of the century, an increase of the trials focusing on cases of indecent exposure could be noticed. Our work, that definitely ascribes itself within the field of Gender Studies and Queer theory, is first and foremost epistemological and seeks to analyze how a body of expertise about homosexuality emerged in the second half of the 19th century, through the medical corpus that turned out to be prevalent in the studies that were conducted then, as well as through both legal and literary texts, although they were quite overlooked then. Our analyses also pertain to the history of representations, as we offer to define the aesthetics of decadence by adding a signifier: homosexuality. Finally, we also plan on scrutinizing texts by relying on three main themes that are meant to emphasize the decadent use of a homotextuality : the symbol of flowers, the figure of the androgyne and the myth of Narcissus.","Russian-Iranian relations before the fall of the Soviet Union have been widely studied. In general, these studies analyze the relationship between Tehran and Moscow from the Russian point of view or in the International context; for example, the imperial rivalries in Asia in the 19th century or the East-West rivalry of the Cold War. Without denying the interest and the pertinence of these studies, this thesis aims at focusing on the Iranian perspectives. Given the ideological guidelines imposed upon the Iranian academic community by the authorities of the Islamic Republic, a new perspective 'is required that focuses on the Iranian perspective on international relations without any khomeinist ideological a priori. This study provides this new perspective as it departs from the khomeinist ideological framework. This study does not use the khomeinist intellectual legacy on international relations as an intellectual reference for studying the relationship between Tehran and Moscow since 1979. Instead, this becomes the object of this study. This particular bias provides an original approach of the Soviet-Russian case in Iranian foreign policy since 1979","The aviation industry has for many years pursued the objective of an optimum level of safetyin the air transport sector. With regard to military aviation, more precisely tactical, thispriority is coupled with an increasingly high and polymorphic search for performance. Whatcharacterize this type of aviation is the relationship between the performance pursued and theaccepted risks. It depends essentially on the context and the stakes of the missions to becarried out.The human factor approach is a major leverage for achieving this challenge. Thus, within theconstrained domain of aeronautics, the design and development of tools to assist crewcognition remains a prospect for the future, even if pilot training also becomes a majorchallenge for the coming years. In this context, the management of cognitive resources, and inparticular the specific management strategies put in place by the pilots, are central to thedecision-making process under constraints.In a research and engineering approach in cognition, we undertook a study involving pilotsand allowing the understanding of these mechanisms as well as the production ofrecommendations for the design of tools to help manage their cognitive resources. On thebasis of the analysis of feedback, and results of a preliminary experimental approach, we havebuilt a protocol to highlight the strategies implemented by the pilots in the context of anactivity during the descent and the final approach on the Clermont-Ferrand airport with acritical breakdown. The experimental results reconciled with our understanding hypotheseson the management of cognitive resources and management strategies, complete our analysisand recommendations for a tool to help manage the resources of the pilots.","International investment law and the European Union constitute two legal systems that are from now on in interaction. The convergence of these systems has been revealed by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which has initiated a transfer of competence in the field of Foreign Direct Investment and thus grants competence to the European Union for the conclusion of new investment treaties. Within the framework of a preliminary chapter, the analysis first attempts to explain why and how international investment law, as it results from the bilateral conventional practice of Member States, and the European Union constitute two interacting legal systems. The legal methodology that is necessary for the study of the manifestations of legal globalisation is described. Subsequently, by distinguishing between the substantive and the procedural aspects of International Investment Law, this thesis focuses on the evolutions of the relations between these two systems and on the results of the ongoing normative interactions. The first part aims to demonstrate that substantial international investment law has been the object of an approach from the European Commission, put in place as soon as the 1990s. As for procedural international investment law, it appears that its links with the European Union have been more tenuous and that it has only been the object of a component which has been attached to the European approach of material international investment law, as soon as the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. On these foundations, the analysis highlights the ongoing Europeanisation process of International Investment Law, which is related to the mode of creation of the international standard, its content and the participation of the European Union in the procedure of dispute resolution, by virtue of an arbitral procedure which should be constructed according to the foreign investor-European Union configuration.","The perception of the human community built by the writer Ayn Rand integrated the principle that a culture cannot exist without a permanent stream of ideas, without the \"independent minds\" to support it, as a human being has an imperative need for a reference space, a comprehensive view of existence - no matter how rudimentary, providing the components of a social consciousness, arguing good and bad, justifying actions and a code of intrinsic values. This assumption generates the research hypotheses of our thesis, the general epistemic level aiming at identifying the functional scale inherent to the totalitarian\u002fMarxist-Leninist regime in Romania, involved in structuring the intellectual environment and instilling a new national identity and tailored to the referential ideological principles. To that end, the basic interrogations propose a less studied topic in the area of historiography regarding the political and cultural post-war context: was there an identitary discourse comprised by the \"new socialist culture\" built by communist ideology? Did the differentiation of the official schematic discourse characterized by an intelligible simplicity for the proletarian masses, give the theoretical discourse on the idea of nation, nationalism, national community characteristics and cultural traditions, the extension\u002fapplication of the defining ideological prerequisites? The standards of the intellectual milieu caused by the totalitarian and destructive effects of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", placed in contrast with the cultural and scientific values of the democratic regimes, implemented a behavioral model dependent on the political interests of the party-state. Thus, our thesis will reconstruct the institutional framework for the creation of the nationalist-identitary discourse, will analyze the formative stages and recurring themes, the patterns of conceptual transformation of the key phrases extracted from the national phenomenon plethora will render the relationship between the actors involved in the construction of national identity.","The objective of this thesis is to analyze the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows towards Africa on economic growth, industrialization, and technological transfer. Analyses aiming at studying the nexuses FDI-economic growth and FDI-industrialization are based on macroeconomic data from respectively 50 and 49 African countries observed during the period from 1980 to 2009; and analyses on FDI related technological spillovers are based on Kenyan firm-level data observed in the manufacturing sector during the period 2012\u002f2013. Concerning the FDI-economic growth nexus, it is found that FDI inflows had a significant impact on economic growth in the African region during the period of interest. It also finds that while the low level of human resources did not limit the impact of FDI, and that the impact of FDI on economic growth was negative or non-significant during the period from 1980 to 1994 and positive during the period from 1995 to 2009. The results indicate that FDI most likely did not have a significant impact on the industrialization of African countries. Concerning the existence of FDI-related technological transfer, it is found that FDI inflows did not spur innovation in local firms competing against multinational firms.","Offset contracts have been developed to regulate international trade transactions which are not taken into account by jurists. As a necessary economic counterbalance to get major international government procurement markets, offset has become essential in international trade. Barely mentioned in the areas of international trade law or international economic law, offset does not fall into any classification within the pre-existing legal classifications. This practice logically preceded its legal conceptualization and remains reluctant to abstraction and differs from country to country. Given its decisive importance in the award of the most important international public contracts, the World Trade Organization has tried to define the offset to prohibit it. This ban is now spreading within international economic law by being taken up in free trade agreements. In the article IV of the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement of the World Trade Organisation, the offset ban concerns the buying country: \"With regard to covered procurement, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not seek, take account of, impose or enforce any offset \u00bb. Despite this ban, the importance of offset in the award of the most important international government procurement is growing irrepressibly.","River contracts and Plans for Water Development and Management are some of the new public action instruments aiming to improve environmental efficacy through regionalisation. Research suggests the hypothesis that this efficacy depends on how actors implementing these systems apprehend their regional dimensions. It proposes the idea of territorial feedback to indicate all the regional and regionalising resources resulting from dialectic and diachronic processes between regional constructions concerning water and projects for its management.The research explores the regional strategies used in drawing up and implementing these systems and analyses their implications in terms of modification of representations and practices and water uses, and hence the environmental condition of resources and aquatic environments. The demonstration uses the empirical case of the Drome valley over the past four decades. The body of the work consists of minutes of meetings, project documents and press articles as well as interviews and mind maps produced with water users and managers.The results of the research concern the mechanisms and conditions through which regional water management can be an indicator of environmental efficacy. Determining factors are provided: (i) assurance of synergy between regional development projects with those of environmental management; (ii) the use of identification dimensions of water management systems and (iii) the intentions and ability to act of certain managers. In this respect, intercommunity structures, and within these, the association of elected representative\u002fdevelopment agents, act as the driving force in activating territorial feedback relative to water management.","In the context of the effects of globalization on an emerging economy, the research presented here is aimed at demonstrating the process of internationalization of middle managers in Indian industrial enterprises, via advanced management training.  These very large public enterprises are both, key actors engaged in deploying globalization effects, and the objects of those transformations. Based on empirical and qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews carried out in these large Indian industrial enterprises, what follows is a report describing and modeling the internationalization of a panel of former participants of a Post Graduated Diploma in Management for Executives (PGPMX), of American MBA inspiration. The originality of this research is to offer a reflexive report of the nature of this training, as the participants experienced it, and the consequences for them professionally and personally. This allows the investigation of the fit of managerial practices and theory as offered by business schools, using the US model vis-\u00e0-vis the managerial demands in Indian enterprises, wrapped in the specificities of the Indian culture. As an interpretative strategy, the data gathered from the extensive field work was treated in reference to the project of Pierre Bourdieu\u2014with particular attention to the figure of habitus, and special focus on modifications of capital\u2019\u2014symbolic, cultural and social; Result show a gain in all three, and reveal a residual tension between the new management principles, and the traditional values. This research, should be of value for the Human Resource Development function of Indian Industrial Enterprises, and for the schools of management\u2014both Indian and Western, that offer these training programs. It should also interest foreign enterprises that seek entry into the Indian market, by enabling a better comprehension of the \u2018symbolic violence\u2019, associated with the intrusion of foreign cultural practices and values.","Among Bombay\u2019s directors, producers and actors, Raj Kapoor (1924-1988) is certainly one of the best known and most original both for his work and for his personality. His vast filmography which constitutes a collection of some of the most beautiful melodramas of Hindi popular cinema remains virtually unknown in France. Close to the people, these melodramas reveal a theme which is universally present, illustrated in a variety of situations and different lights. It is the phenomenon of incomprehension.The present work, inspired by a reading of Peter Brooks and Stanley Cavell on the subject of melodrama, aims to show that Kapoor\u2019s melodramas treat this specific theme which unites them and allows them to be defined as a distinct cinematic genre here termed \"melodrama of incomprehension.\" The feeling of inability to understand or of being misunderstood which haunts these melodramas is gleaned not only from aesthetic, historical, political and cultural subjects but also from personal experience.Drawing on the aesthetics of melodrama, Kapoor multiplies the metaphorical presence of the blind hero illustrating the overwhelming difficulty of communication, and blames society for a lack of understanding. Extending the resulting suffering to a wider context, Kapoor\u2019s melodrama transcends the bounds of individual drama, reaching out to the level of the people as a whole, indeed to the entire nation according to some authors. To amplify the phenomenon of incomprehension, his melodrama uses misunderstanding, scorn, ignorance, confusion, illusion, and more. Kapoor does this to a point at which these difficulties of communication clearly represent identifiable structural elements in his portrayal of incomprehension imbued with melancholy and sadness.","Since 2011, law and neuroscience have had a unique relationship. The law of bioethics of July 7, 2011 makes France the first country in the world to enact, through a legislative text, the use of brain imaging techniques for legal expertise examinations. In this context, France assists to the emergence of a \u00ab neurodroit \u00bb. Translated from the English neologism \u00ab neurolaw \u00bb, the neurolaw is a new medical-legal concept that incorporates neuroscience research results from brain imaging techniques into the legal process. The most well known, and the most controversial, brain imaging technique that neurolaw uses is the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. The contribution of neuroscience to legal issues is therefore considerable : on the one hand, it uses brain imaging as evidence at trial in search of the truth, and on the other hand it legitimizes, and provides an understanding for how judicial actors and magistrates make their decisions. But beyond its uniqueness, the relationship between neuroscience and the law is still limited. While France is the only country in the world to have legislatively addressed this \u00ab neurolaw \u00bb and in theory neurolaw is useful, there is currently no use in practice. However, while the neurodroit is only at its beginning stage in France, by continuing to perfect the brain imaging techniques, and by continuing to better understand people\u2019s behaviors, Neurolaw will soon be able to provide the possibility of a better and improved legal system","Our object of study is based on the naturalization of foreigners in France. Thus our goal in this research is to explain and make intelligible the phenomenon of acquisition of French nationality within the Algerian immigration. Our analysis is to relate changes in perceptions, motivations, strategies and desires of these \"new\" French, being also citizens of another country, with their backgrounds, their socio-professional status and their geographical origin. This raises the question of renewal of the modes of adaptation to the host society. Thus the relationship within the host society depends on the place the original society has in both daily life and in the representations of these \"old migrants\". Dual citizenship is generally determined by the ambivalent relationship between the two societies, first the original society to which we are attached, second with the host society in which we chose to live. This usually marks this dual identity by some forms of ambiguity and worse, suspicion. From there, questioning the relevance of the issue of civic allegiances in these \"Franco-Algerian\" is imposed on us. Based on empirical work, our study therefore fuels questions about the relationship between multiple allegiances and \u002f or affiliations and modern citizenship. We are trying to answer this question by focusing and problematizing the question of allegiance to the nation state of the host country and confront it to the modern conception of citizenship that has emerged in recent decades within industrialized countries. In this perspective, this cross between modern citizenship and \"multiple allegiances\" allows us to reveal some essential questions in this research area as to the meaning and understanding of political participation in the host society and the issue of religious practice of Islam in this case.","Understanding the impacts of climate policies in China and their dynamics is essential for the international climate policy. This thesis contributes to this debate by analyzing the costs and opportunities for China to transition to a low-carbon economy in an adverse overall economic context. It provides macroeconomic evaluation of the costs of mitigation in China using a Computable General Equilibrium model in a second-best framework. The tool used captures important element that are not systematically covered by exiting analyses, like inertia constraints, imperfect expectations and non optimal exploitations of production factors (labor, capital). Beyond the comprehensive assessment of climate mitigation costs, the thesis allows (i) exhibiting the mechanisms underlying these costs in the short-term and in the long-term, and thus (ii) revealing levers that might be used to reduce them. Furthermore, the conducted analyses demonstrate that beyond the carbon price, the costs of climate policy essentially depend on the sequencing of complementary policies, with a crucial role of bottom-up measures likely to complement the carbon price. It proclaims that an innovative development pathway with a sustainable future will require implementing local measures able to (i) provide appropriate incentives for long-term investments by resorting to other signals than current market prices and (ii) incorporate sectoral measures that act complementarity.","The \"Art Deco\" label appeared in the middle of the nineteen sixties to designate furniture and architectures from the interwar period. The style's outlines evolved considerably over time, and it is thus possible to distinguish three different waves of description.The first one is centered around France and the 1925 Exposition internationale des Arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes, and focuses mainly on furniture. It often presents Art Deco and Modernism as two opposites, and views the former as the sign of a decadent society, unable to understand the realities of the period and face its challenges. Art Deco is condemned by most authors as an anachronistic prolongation of the decorative principle, while some, on the contrary, see it as a last \"moment of happiness\".The second wave is essentially anglophone and American (whereas the first one was mostly French and Italian) It also appeared in the nineteen sixties, and gives preeminence to architecture rather than artefacts. Its foundation is completely different from the first wave since Art Deco is viewed as the \"other modern\" or an alternative modernity, a new definition very much influenced by the developing postmodern theories.Lastly, the third wave, which is more recent, appears to be a prolongation of the second one. It is a based on notions such as hybridity or malleability and views Art Deco as a grammar which can be easily adapted in very different contexts. Powered by a strong heritage movement, it concerns places such as Miami Beach, Bombay\u002fMumbai or Napier (New Zealand). In the French speaking world, however, this approach remains relatively rare, and concurrent notions such as that of colonial architecture are often preferred, even though recent publications about Casablanca constitute an exception.","The pacing is a complex mechanism which depends on the ability of athletes to adjust their available resources in the face of various environmental and psycho-cognitive factors. The objective of this thesis was to determine the factors contributing to the adjustment of pacing strategies during self-paced endurance exercises. The results of the study A show (i) a daily variation in 10 km endurance performance on cycle ergometer (TT10km) and a fluctuation in muscle power output with a peak observed at the end of the afternoon, and (ii) a daily variation in oxygen uptake during TT10km self-paced exercise. The results of the study B show (i) a deleterious effect of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on endurance performance and a decrease in running speed throughout the 12-minute running exercise, (ii) an alteration of cardiorespiratory responses during this exercise, and (iii) an alteration of psycho-cognitive responses following PSD. The results of the study C show (i) a deleterious effect of mental fatigue on endurance performance, power output as well as cadence during a TT10km exercise, (ii) a lack of the effect of mental fatigue on cardiorespiratory responses, and (iii) a higher RPE following a mentally fatiguing task. All the results of the present thesis show that athletes modify their running speed or their power output to adapt to new constraints related to the time of day, sleep deprivation and mental fatigue.","We propose to study in this thesis, a key issue and relatively little discussed in the French research in educational sciences, it concerns the genesis of pupil learning and their evolution during the tuition. We mobilize a longitudinal data (Panel 1997) and the results of a musical experimentation in kindergarten to answer to these questions: How are structured the first acquisitions of pupils and how is it linked to the school context and socio-economic variables? How the cognitive abilities of students affect their academic performance? Are specific activities can improve academic skills through an increase in cognitive abilities? Implicative analysis conducted on panel data has revealed a hierarchical structure of students' skills and the importance of cognitive skills on academic performance. The review of the literature demonstrates that it is possible to increase the academic performance of students by developing some of these cognitive abilities, and that music is a particularly effective tool in this sense. Therefore, we sought to empirically test the impact of music on cognitive ability and academic performance of students by our experimental research. It relies on a robust methodology which guarantees the validity of results derived from it. The result of difference in differences analyzes, confirmed by item response theory, is inconclusive for the impact of music on the progression of cognitive abilities. However, we have shown and verified via Heckman model that the experimental treatment has an effect on the academic performance of pupils.","My thesis is about \"Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer's writing : the third shore of the river\". I propose taking advantage of a regional space as a material and symbolic reality. Running my eyes over the litarary discourse of several Latin American writers of the 20th century, I analyse it as a territory in which various passages relate a psychic and imaginary space. In consequence, in Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer's (Santa Fe 1937-Paris 2005) literary work, I explored, supported by a bibliography of literary theory and criticism produced over his work, the following aspects : 1. The foundation of the \"zone\" and the \"city\", representations of territories of fiction. The hatch of a saga and development of characters and places. 2. The relationship between the construction of imaginary territories from other writers (Onetti, Faulkner) and Roberto Arlt's rabid city. 3. The \"death of the author\" in the most radical narrative experience of Saer's writing. The intersection of Argentine history, fiction stories and analysis of the violence in his short stories and novels. 5. The landscape of the area related, on one hand with the natural and mythical space and on the other hand with personal experience. 6. Linkages with the modern literary traditions : Borges, Joyce, the Nouveau Roman and Antonio di Benedetto.","Audiovisual information are part of our daily life either for professional needs or simply for leisure purposes. The plethoric quantity of data requires the use of compression for both storage and transmission, which may alter the audiovisual quality if it does not account for perceptual aspects. The literature on saliency and quality is very rich, often ignoring the audio component playing an important role in the visual scanpath and the quality of experience. This thesis aims at contributing in overing the lack of multimodal approaches, by following a dedicated experimental procedures. The proposed work is twofold: visual attention modelling and multimodal quality evaluation. First, in order to better understand and analyze the influence of audio on humain ocular movements, we run several eyetracking experiments involving a panel of observers and exploiting a video dataset constructed for our context. The importance of faces has been confirmed, particularly for talking faces having an increased saliency. Following these results, we proposed an audiovisual saliency model based on locutors detection in video and relying on spatial and temporal low-\u00adlevel features. Afterward, the influence of audio on multi-modal and multi-devices quality has been studied. To this end, psychovisual experiments have been conducted with the aim to quantify the multimodal quality in the context of video streaming applications where various display devices could be used.","The general subject of the thesis is the psychological health in the work, more particularly, itis question to understand the previous history of the problems of psychological health in thework and to detect the means to develop a prosperity in the work and\\or to prevent thedeterioration of the conditions of psychological health of the social workers. Thepsychological health is arrested in this search as a shape bidimensionnelle by mentioning thehealth not only as the absence of disease, but also as the presence of positive aspects (Achille,2003; Keyes, 2005). From this perspective, we chose to estimate the health through thepsychological well-being, through the psychological distress and through the burnout. Thepsychological well-being establishes the positive pole and the psychological distress and theburnout train the negative pole. The model of the psychological health in the work was testedwith 369 social workers of the region Nord-Pas de Calais.The scientific interest of the research is to understand not only the causes of the problems ofpsychological health in the work but also the causes of \"good one\" psychological health toanticipate the evolution of the psychological health of the workers so as to prevent theappearance of psychological problems. Our objective, by means of conversations and ofquestionnaires, was to identify the organizational variables which can act positively ornegatively on the psychological health in the work. We showed the central place of thesatisfaction of the psychological needs in the study of the psychological health in the work.For that purpose, our study is inspired by the projected model of psychological health in thework proposed by Boudrias, Savoie & Brunet (2007). The basic premise leaves the theory ofthe self-determination (Deci & Ryan, 2000) supporting that the individual comes true in thework if the environment of this one favors the satisfaction of its needs for autonomy, forcompetence and for social membership. The satisfaction of these three psychological needs isthe resultant of varied inductors which can be situational such as the organizational justice,the social support, the workload and the emotional charge and of personal inductors such asthe resilienceThe results show that the impact strength, the social support and the organizational justice arepredictive variables of the good to be and of the personal fulfillment. Besides, the workloadand the emotional charge favor the distress and the burnout. Exactly, the organizational justice contributes, on one hand, to the well-being and to thepersonal fulfillment and on the other hand, the perception of a lack of a justice in the middleof work generate some distress, some emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Analysesdemonstrate that a load of high work can rest the psychological distress of the social workers.The hierarchical support explains the components of the burnout. Finally, the resilience turnsout to be a factor of protection.The main hypothesis of this thesis is that the satisfaction of the psychological needs exercisesa mediating effect between the various inductors and the psychological health in the work.Globally, the satisfaction of the need for autonomy mediatizes totally on one hand, the linksbetween the justice and the well-being and, between the workload and the distress as well asthe emotional exhaustion. Then, the analyses of mediations indicate that the satisfaction of theneed for competence mediatizes partially on one hand, the link between the justice and thewell-being, on the other hand between, the impact strength, the hierarchical support and thepersonal fulfillment. Finally, we observe that the satisfaction of the need for socialmembership mediatizes totally the link between the workload and the distress.","This research is in line with current work aimed at clarifying the relationship between plural and complex reasoning and learning. It examines the impact of authentic contextualizations and epistemological disruptions in the treatment of a socioscientific issue: Human Gene Therapy. We tried to identify the reasons behind the positions taken by 21 students aged 19 to 21 years in the second year of training in a biotechnology institute about the uncertain and controversial question of the use of gene transfer technology in human gene therapy. We have implemented classroom discussions separated by phases of epistemological disruptions. During these activities, discussions in small groups using research data on authentic situations of gene therapy about already made gene therapy and gene therapy in the making. We also conducted a work of challenging the model of Crick based on recent results of molecular genetics and genomics. Taking into account the nature of the object of our research, we have mobilized several theoretical frameworks: the didactic framework on socio-scientific issues, the framework of language interactions and argumentation. We have also mobilized several tools to analyze the speech of students and study the effect of our teaching strategy on the construction of new knowledge and on the positions taken by students. Our analysis showed that the strategy has \u201cwarmed\u201d the question of using human gene therapy. We observed many changes in students\u2019 positions. These situations have led to the recognition of the complexity inherent in a successful gene therapy, to the consideration of the issue from multiple perspectives (scientific, ethical, social and economic) and to the realization that gene therapy experiments are on the front of research. During discussions about gene therapy in check, students submit more empirical evidence of audits, evaluations and reviews. They use current data from molecular biology to enhance their assessments. We found that the intensity of the argument and the number of justifications have increased significantly from one discussion to another one.","The study of international practice demonstrates that the obligation to prevent in international environmental law is neither uniform nor automatically applicable to all situations. Rather it encompasses two distinct obligations: on one hand, international law demands that the state adopts due measures of surveillance and control upon the activities that take place within its territory or jurisdiction; on the other hand, international law creates an absolute obligation for states to not cause transboundary harm. In other words, either international law recognizes an obligation to prevent certain behavior or it recognizes an obligation to prevent certain result. This distinction is essential not only when observing wrongful acts but also when ascertaining the international responsibility of a state. Thus, in the case of an obligation of result, the mere fact that harm occurred or that the due expected result was not achieved suffice to configure a breach of obligation. However, in the case of an obligation of means, the actual behavior of the state should be contrasted with the behavior prescribed by international law to verify the existence or not of a breach of obligation.","This study aims to explore and understand the substantive area of parental decision-making and its main concern to develop a theory of parental behavior towards children health in an everyday life context in Asian developing countries, which are characterized by unstructured and uncertain healthcare systems. We employed classic grounded theory method and analyzed data collected in Vietnam from 34 interviews with parents and pharmacy staff and six health-related themes of a parental online forum. We observed patterns of behaviors that under the conditions of high-level uncertainties and mistrust in multiple social relationships, living the social norms and role identity, parents in Asian developing countries extend their lay selves into the informal reasoning of medication. Health care services and medications are not just products or services but a process in which parents immerse themselves to build their experience. We propose a novel theory of parental immersion of the lay self into medication reasoning. We defined the construct of immersing the lay self as the devotion of parents\u2019 mentality and the occupancy of parents\u2019 centrality to the health care of children. We argue that consumer immersion does not necessarily happen in extraordinary hedonic settings, but it is also embedded in the everyday life experience of parents and reflected through various social contracts and interactions in Asian developing countries. Our proposed theory provides a greater understanding of parental health behaviors of immersion regarding children\u2019s health and medications in developing countries. The construct of lay self immersion expands the concept of healthcare involvement and requires further studies and conceptualization from a broader view of consumer involvement.","Countries are reforming their water public utilities in order to introduce a new regulatory system called Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). IWRM may be centralized, decentralized or in-between. What is the dynamic behind this rationale?We will examine the contributions of religion, law, economics, political science and management to regulation. These contributions shall be combined with those of neo-institutional and bureaucracy theories in order to create some regulatory tools such as yardstick competition, ring fencing competition and price-cap regulation.We will also study public service, public utility and universal service. We will also examine water, gas, electricity and telecommunications characteristics in order to highlight the water utility specificities.We will use grounded theories and analytic narrative elements in studying in-depth the water public utility regulation in two countries with reference models, in six countries with hybrid models and two international reference hybrid models. A qualitative model with core and ancillary dynamics will be sketched.Quantitative techniques will confirm\u002finfirm this dynamic through a questionnaire that will be tested on a database consisting of 106 countries in order to produce a quantitative model of this dynamic.Finally, the qualitative and quantitative models will be compared in order to produce a final model of water public utility dynamics of regulation which will be theoretically discussed.","The big bang caused by the meeting of human life and law has led to the creation of several legal prescriptions that have human life as their object. Despite their heterogeneous nature, it is possible to outline a common structure, enabling stability and unity in the relationship between human life and law. The law of human life is the structuring concept of this relationship. Mustered as a new key to reading their relationship, the law of human life should make it possible to identify all the dynamics that make them oscillate.Precisely, the law of human life is subject to opposing currents. A first trend uses the law as an instrument to increase the respect for life. A second liberal current tends to solicit the exercise of control over life, reflecting the movement towards the subjectivisation of fundamental rights and freedoms, to which the valorisation of personal autonomy provides fertile ground. The law of human life thus has a dual nature, the right to respect for life forging its objective nature, the right over life revealing its subjective nature. These two rights are seemingly antagonistic. However, taking into account the degree of subjectivisation of the law of human life allows us to qualify the influence of this phenomenon on it. The State, charged with the task of striking a balance between these two poles, sets itself up as the guardian of respect for life, with the deployment of the regime of control over life being controlled or even curbed. The balance of power within the law of human life turns out to be disproportionate to the right to respect for life. The duplication of the law of human life allows the right to respect for life and the right over life to coexist without causing their mutual neutralisation.","This ethnographic study examines the construction process of a \"pioneer\" peasant community founded during the occupation of a private property located at a settlement frontier's far end, near the Andean foothills of the Bolivian Amazon. This local history is embedded in a \"redistributive sequence\" that continually repeatsin a \"pioneer area\" where Andeans farmers have implemented the agrarian reform law (enacted in 1953) and imported the organizational model of \"agrarian syndicalism\" forged in the \"High lands\" before the 1952 revolution. This \"redistributive sequence\" revolves around thre \"momements\" that correspond to the logic of collective action structuring the emerging \"landless\" peasant community: grabbing the land; asking its endowment to recieve it from the State; sharing it. The centralo agent of this sequence is \"the pioneer organization\" created by the \"landless\" peasants to occupy and share the land considered vacant because of its improductivity, and to seek formal ownership from the State on the basis of the agrarian law. Operating as \"mediator\" of State redistribution and allowing newcomers to settle on vacant land, \"the pioneer organization\" activates the \"internal political border\" process of the Bolivian nation-state.","The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. This notion reveals all its importance especially in contemporary semiotics. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of object of analysis. Nevertheless linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics. Comparing these two different approaches we realise that many theories of text have developed their own research on a common background made by basic hermeneutic problems which gave rise to some epistemological and philosophical questions. Therefore it\u2019s necessary to revalue the epistemological relationship between semiotics and hermeneutics to understand something new about text. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, the new perspective opened by an interpretative semiology represents a crossroads for these two complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text acts among contemporary disciplines of language. Then analysing the disciplines concerned, we can realise its polysemy. This research tries to clarify this terminological and conceptual complexity.","Recent debates on political thought often circle around the concepts of democracy and recognition. Jacques Ranci\u00e8re is mostly known for his work on the former, but in his archival studies of the Nineteenth Century French workers\u2019 movement the latter appears central. Starting from his idea of \u201cpost-democracy\u201d, this study claims that Ranci\u00e8re doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctheory\u201d of democracy or of recognition that would provide an exact explanation of what these concepts mean. Rather, both are objects of a \u201ccritical intervention\u201d in favour of \u201cthe part that has no part\u201d in the political space. However, the way in which Ranci\u00e8re develops his intervention has taken different forms. In fact, in his mature period he classifies the social space as the \u201cpolice\u201d order in a way that risks to produce a dichotomy with \u201cpolitics\u201d. At the same time, he nonetheless thinks the agency of the socio-political subject between the domain of the social and the domain of politics. Such an interrelation has been explored extensively in the 70s, in his early writings on the \u201cworkers\u2019 speech\u002fvoice\u201d [parole ouvri\u00e8re] of 1830-1851 as a social experience twisting the non-recognition by means of the nomination of a supplementary subject. In the 80s, Ranci\u00e8re changed his position moving away from the analysis of the social experience while scrutinizing more deeply the individual experience of the wrong. The goal was a \u201csuspensive\u201d idea of recognition. Thus, to evaluate such a transformation, this dissertation places Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s work in the contemporary debate through critical confrontations with some thinkers and traditions. Finally, the study stresses that the Ranci\u00e8rian \u201ccritical intervention\u201d should be understood as a way of thinking and intervening informed by the experiences of the wrong.","The main objective of our doctoral thesis in Egyptology was to create a typology of the private, funerary and votive stelae dating from the Third Intermediate Period of the Roman era, in order to characterize them according to their origin and to analyse them quantitatively and qualitatively. This approach enabled us to ascertain the origin of certain stelae, as well as determine the different recognized types for each origin, and to provide a typological tool facilitating the identification of other stelae whose origin had hitherto been unknown. Datins was also taken into account in defining the periods during which an iconographic or textual element was used, and that led us to redraw the chronological development of the late Egyptian stelae, by outlining their principal characteristics and highlighting their numerous specificities. In order to achieve this work, we had to create a data base named \"St\u00e8les\", which fulfils one of our essential aims : to create a tool accessible to all. The \"St\u00e8les\" can serve as a base for other studies, facilitating the checking and cross-checking of information, without having to leave out referenced documents, and, in the end, to provide a precious gain in research time. With this aim in mind, the consulation of the \"St\u00e8les\" base will be freely available online on Internet, via the Halma-Ipel CNRS laboratory server","The phenomenon of dropouts in VAE is problematic. It calls into question the very foundations of this device. Our study focuses on the effects that different modes of support can produce to stem the phenomenon of VAE abandonment. Can adapting the accompaniment according to the problems of the life of the person make it possible to avoid the abandonment? Is it possible to identify the intention to leave and act early on the triggering event? We posit that the quality of the accompaniment is crucial. In this context, the support appears under new contours as a development resource not only professional but also personal. Working on the construction of the link and its quality throughout the accompaniment would help to avoid abandonment, at least could reduce it considerably. This study proposes to analyze this process and to identify its functional and dysfunctional aspects. This study aimed at understanding the mechanisms and processes involved in dropouts will also improve the practice of accompaniment.","Contrarily to the pioneer and militant ecological communities (in the 70s and 90s), and also to the first north-European eco-neighbourhoods run by local authorities during the huge press events in the middle of the 90\u2019s, French eco-neighbourhoods come under progressive integration of the durable city\u2019 principles within the modes of production for the ordinary urban space (years 2000). On this account, they consist in fabricating within an emancipated frame, activism and experimentation of new facilities (parks, road works, etc.) in compliancy with principles of durability. This attempt to generalise innovative techniques within the French urban fabrication is accompanied by a myriad of educative plans of action instilled to workers concerned by the project, and future inhabitants of the quarter. These tools assist in instilling new savoir-faire and savoir-vivre necessary for the implementation and functioning of ecological techniques to the different targeted publics. Thus, social usages of workers and inhabitants matter to those who fabricate eco-neighbourhoods. This matter underscores the hiatus between the imaginative figure of the user expected by the fabrication and reality of social practices, which usages regulate. It is indicative of the socially subversive character in the production of ecological and technological innovations, and at the same time the existence of new expectations on social practices.","This thesis examines the construction of masculinities by athletes invested in a high-Level sporting career. Our investigation is based on ethnographic observations during sports training and interviews (n = 48) conducted with athletes (n = 38) and coaches (n = 10) in a Pole Espoir of handball (n = 8) of rugby (n = 13) and in a Pole France of french boxing (n = 13), in two Poles France of ice skating in the individual category (n = 11), and in three clubs at Quebec (n = 3). The first contribution of this thesis lies in the linkage between the two theoretical frameworks used in Sport Sociology respectively in English and French language. We analyzed our data using the concepts - gender order, gender regime and hegemonic masculinity - developed by Raewyn Connell and those - field, habitus and capital - developed by Pierre Bourdieu. We proposed to consider that the sports field is governed by a form of hegemonic masculinity. This form would be defined as an ideal configuration of affiliations, dispositions and capital favourable to promote the re-Productivity of agents in the social game. We have seen that this form was malleable. There is a plurality of hegemonic masculinities in relation to specific gender regime of each discipline and more precisely with the local gender order which is geographically and institutionally anchored. The second contribution of this thesis lies in the study of the process of masculinities hybridization in relation to the increase of institutional requirements. Contrary to an essentialist conception of hegemonic masculinity, we note that this latter is characterized by the plurality of its facets and its plasticity. The athletes, who are the most conform to the hegemonic form in their discipline, develop a capacity to enter into a variety or mixed dispositional uses. They are always more \"fit for fighting\", but more subtle in the uses of violence and their bodies, that they learn to manage as a capital (aesthetic, hygienic). In addition, they put away the expression of sexism and homophobia, which still does not really allow reconsidering the unequal value of sexes, genders and sexualities in sports field.","This dissertation, using the theory of linguistic neoteny, supports the idea that the order initially established by a language in a speaker who has become bilingual at a later stage is no longer stable at the time when the second language is inserted, and subsequently an unequal competition between the two languages becomes apparent. There exists an interdependence between the language and the identity of the speaker. The subordinated French-Persian bilingual, who has immigrated to a francophone area at the age of linguistic adulthood, tries to insert another system of linguistic behavior, another mode of being, in a cognitive space which does not sustain the need to continue to function normally. Thus, s\u002fhe overcomes his\u002fher Persian monolingualism, that is, his\u002fher natural specialization, in order to opt for French-Persian bilingualism.The French-Persian bilingual child born into alinguistically mixed family is theoretically conceived to create his\u002fher immanent being in both languages.But in reality, the value ascribed to a language, schooling, the choice of family language, and several other determining factors significantly affect the speaker\u2019s choice of his\u002fher preferred language. If the French-Persian bilingual\u2019s sense of self-sufficiency allows him\u002fher to identify him-\u002fherself as a speaker of French to the satisfaction of his\u002fher linguistic environment, the appropriation and practice of Persian in his\u002fher family are no longer strictly necessary because s\u002fhe sees him-\u002fherself in a mental, cultural and linguistic universe whose oral reality is more relevant to the social sphere.","As a very technical and old fashion language that makes use of terms and phrases drawn from a foreign mind frame by the craft of History, the Malagasy law speech is hardly accessible to the population, though it has been intended to him. Consequently, it is not rare that justice decisions are barely executed, or even not at all, by the receivers who just do not understand what they are supposed to do. Hence, very serious prejudices come up for him\u002fher whose sole guilt is not to understand neither French law speech due to amadel of thought that is far away from his own, nor official Malagasy law speech mould on the French madel with a thematic structure based on a logic system which is at the straight opposite of his\u002fher way of thinking. This work is a contribution to modernize some old fashion terms still found in the Malagasy law speech on one hand, and on the other hand to modify the structure of the justice decision texts in order to fit Malagasy people's own mind frame. This should hopefully make Malagasy law speech much more understandable for the people, and by this way, to improve their relationship with Justice, so that the institution to fully play its role of a social regulator leading to a sustainable and integral human development.","The principle of unavailability of the human body has been thought in two different ways : as a prohibition of selling or giving someone, as a prohibition of causing a breaching physical integrity. We defend that the principle of unavailability of the human body still remains under these two apsects, but not exactly within the same meaning. It takes the form of a violation-saving principle, which prevents from all unnecessary violations of bodily integrity, and which aims not to prohibit but to avoid the bodily integrity violations, by its external side, and to limit those, by its internal side. It also takes the form of a principle of non-negociation, which prohibits that pressures may be exercised onto someone to make a person accept an infringement on her body. These two aspects extend in public law the principle of unavailability which already existed in private law. This principle is however threatened by the health requirement, more and more subjective, and by the interference of profit-making interests. These two logic allow some violations of bodily integrity for reasons unlinked to health, but for economic ones.","In the works of Patrick Modiano, the incoherent memorys which are to be accompanied by the dysfunction is an important theme. The concept of the imperfect memory could develop after the experiencing psychotrauma in youth and childhood. To find the hidden truth, the narrators search for indications in the parts of the story memorized in a retrospective way. The separation between \u00ab I narrate \u00bb and \u00ab I narrated \u00bb is always present. It is the source of chronology particular to the works of Modiano. The elasticity of the time between both of them, or  an order and a disorder of chronology between the events coexist, while each story is not uniform in speed of development. It seemed that the particular method of narration could represent an intermittent memory. In our thesis, we study the mechanism of memory tied in the plotline proper to the works of Modiano, throught the narratological approach. More than one plotline prevents making a clear distinction between plot-lines and sub plot-lines. The insertions comments of the narrator who considers an event of past time produce an memory. At the end of our thesis, we try to emphasize his poetry and theme preference with a tragic memory in the youth and with the worthlessness of birth that reveal itself inside the memory.","This dissertation is about melodised speech among theYezidis in Armenia. On the dividing line between music and language, this specific sound register, which the Yezidis call\u00a0 \u201cwords on\u201d (kilam\u00ea ser), is linked to feelings of sadness. It consists primarily of spoken words, melodised in ritual contexts (such as the funerals) but also in daily life conversations. This way of using sounds is of particular interest for the Yezidis, and although they do not consider it as \u00ab\u00a0music\u00a0\u00bb, it is not rare to find kilam\u00ea ser recorded on tapes and compact disks on the local markets. The analysis of the formal and performative characteristics of the kilam\u00ea ser shows how this specific use of speech constructs a sonic space where emotions are shared. It serves as a linchpin for Yezidi conceptions of exile, sacrifice, hero\u00efsm and mourning. Beyond individual catharsis, melodised words transform absence into presence, and integrate death to the life of the community.The argument developped in the text is illustrated by a large corpus of field documents presented on a multimedia DVD.","Building on the poetic works of the migrant poet questions arise. Is poetry the appropriate genre to exhibit displacement? In which case, is it possible to identify the expressive traits to define the poetry of displaced poets? Our research is focusing on the relation between the poetic writing and foreignness, through the analysis of the works of three Latin American displaced poets: Jorge Boccanera (1952), Argentine exiled in Mexico and abroad, and years later in Costa Rica; Fabio Mor\u00e1bito (1955), Italo-Mexican who writes in Spanish, a language which was adopted after settling in Mexico; and the Peruvian Eduardo Chirinos (1960-2016), circumstantial exiled in the United States, where he moved due to academic and professional reasons. The poetry of these migrants deepens into an existential dispersion, which has impacts on a disorientated identification, beyond national identity. Their \u00abmigratory poetry\u00bb transits through foreignness, turning the word into a moving home, into rejection, or even into integration. By means of temporary space traits, thematic references to the bestiary and to childhood, and reflections of the rhetoric, the poetic text is able to evoke the travel and also able to be a travel itself.","Safety issues in the broad sense take part, rightly or wrongly, in how large housing developments are pictured. As attractiveness (consequently the inversion of the depreciated picture they suffer from) is the major lever of urban renewal politics led under the aegis of ANRU, this thesis deals with local public policies supposed to address insecurity, and with their spatial and organisational outcomes, through the example of Toulouse.A three-years immersion in municipal offices nurtured the research material ; the thesis analyzes these policies\u2019 development, including their individual components. The findings provide insights into inequities between neighbourhoods (which partly result from the distinction between common law and specific policies applied to the targeted districts, and can affect public authorities\u2019 perception itself), inertia and resistance to innovation in local governments and administrations, policy change driven by political investment (even if only symbolically), and variability and fragility of public policy-making : behind the image of standardisation and uniformity of local public policies (resulting from the increase of normative frameworks), the thesis points out the resurgence of ideological orientations in policy-making, and questions the weight of general interest compared to tactical matters in the conquest and exercise of political power.","This dissertation aims to articulate the concept of creative production in terms of what many consider to be its antithesis, bureaucracy. lt emerges from the desire to increase our understanding of creativity by examining it in a type of organization where it is less likely to be observed. ln substantial terms, bureaucracies are considered in light of the rules that regulate them, an idea we articulate further using the concept of organizational routines. Our study is divided in two parts. The first contains the theoretical aspects that culminate with an ecological model of the bureaucratie organization that follows the notion of organizational routines. This section is further subdivided: the f\u00efrst chapter is dedicated to the introduction of the principal concepts, namely bureaucracy and creativity. An in-depth discussion of these concepts follows in Chapter 2, where we further explore the etymology and attributed meanings of the somewhat nebulous term, \"bureaucracy\". This chapter also lays out the theoretical framework (and its attendant constraints) with which we examine the trajectories of new ideas within public administration. Chapter 3 presents a short history of creativity, followed by a discussion of collective creativity, which we implicitly associate with organizational routines in the bureaucratie context. These routines are considered in their many forms and categories, each of which represents a specific imagination of the bureaucratie organization.The second part features an empirical analysis of the issue of creativity. Our methodology, inspired by the praxeological view of the Austrian School, is distinct insofar as it posits a radical division between theory and empiricism. Chapter 4 clarifies the implications of this standpoint and describes our approach. Chapter 5 presents the case principally from the point of view of secondary documents, and we introduce our case-study, the Council of Europe, with a principal focus on its historical dimensions. This chronological approach helps us describe a number of attitudes, routines, and beliefs that inform the critical approach of Chapter 6. This last chapter describes elements relevant to the circulation of ideas in the context of the Council of Europe, particularly as they pertain to structure and incentives within the administration.","By the end of the 19th century, Joan of Arc became one of the key character, shaped and raised as a symbol, she is at the core of political stakes. The Camille Vallery Radot's collection fits this context. She was born in 1880 and was contemporary of that period. She became passionate about Joan of Arc at the early age to her death in 1927. She collected everything she can find about her heroin, in total around 10 000 documents. This collection is a certain contemporary viewpoint, even exhaustive, of the period which will gradually built the Pucelle d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans to a strong mother country symbol. Her collection witnesses the creation of myth and cult of Joan of Arc for the entire French population to become a product to rising tourism. Joan of Arc becomes the mainspring of cultural politics which arise at that time. In Rouen, preservation and development of patrimony linked to the heroin is deep in the heart of the procedures that leads not only to a commemoration, but also to a challenge of attractiveness issue.","In Oceania, the cultural renaissances are very often tackled in the researches (namely French ones) from the standpoint of the \u00ab invention of tradition \u00bb, from a perspective that favours a methodological nationalism, playing down their epistemic scope. In order to allow the full reception of those cultural renaissances in the scientific field, this thesis roots itself in a decolonial approach and sets those processes in the following theoretical frame: the enunciation of a difference. While focusing on the study of Tahitian, Marquesan and Mangarevan cultural renaissances (in French Polynesia), I report on the geographical dimension of those movements. To cut short the linear and historicist approach, I develop a scalar analysis (most of the time spatial scales, but also temporal ones) of the enunciation of those differences. After reminding the existence of controversies regarding m\u0101\u2019ohi cultural nationalism and the primacy of the archipelago scale in the development of different cultural renaissances in French Polynesia, I highlight how this territory fringes benefit from a reconsideration, throughout those processes. On a smaller scale, I question the low spread of the Oceania perspective, often neglected for the benefit of a subregionalism centered on the \u201cPolynesia triangle\u201d. This leads me to consider the possibility, even the slightest one, that those cultural renaissances, while falling within dominant scalar and territorial order, could pose a critical and mobilizing load, able to subvert a statu quo, marked by coloniality.","During the 20th century, the position of Cartesian epistemology has been much criticized. The transparency of the mind, as well as our authentic access to our own mental states, have been continuously attacked by arguments that attempt to reveal the fallibility of our putatively foundational cognitions. The famous problem of the speckled hen is representative; some epistemologists have also configured fictional scenarios where our foundational cognitions suffer from strange cognitive process or unfavorable epistemic environment, so that the relevant cognitions are no longer reliable, a fortiori infallible; others directly state that there are fundamental cognitions that are actually mistaken. These three groups of fallibilist objections are not flawless, but there are no systematic and sufficiently solid responses that defend the infallibility thesis either. In this dissertation, we shall reconstruct a model of intuition on the basis of Descartes\u2019 Regulae ad directionem ingenii. The model will be used to refute most of the contemporary anti-Cartesian objections. It also provides a new interpretation of Descartes\u2019 Meditations and other related texts.","Orientalism -as Edward Said defined it- is a paradigm of which power and currentness are also expressed in cinema. Representations of Maghreb countries conveyed by and within European culture have formed overtime, an \u201cOriental-fiction\u201d that has moved into and settled in the core of many \u201cMaghrebis\u201d film-makers\u2019 creations. These films perpetuate and recreate an \u201cEast-of-the West\u201d. They reproduce the depictions and speeches of a fiction that is still alive as much as necessary to the gratifying mirror of the dominant (western) world. They feed the European public with a cinema made out of stories that seem built in the imaginary realm of orientalist stratifications. This \"orientalist self-fiction\" carried by Maghrebi cinema, obstructs and distorts the actual spaces these films aim to reveal. It also exposes the subjective ambivalence that lies within their symbolization project. Crushed by the necessity to document alterity, these films end up inevitably entangled in the colonial dialectics of domination and doomed to repeat them. The critical analysis carried by this work is based upon a broad corpus of films that were mostly co-produced and filmed in Morocco in the 2000s. At the confluents of aesthetics, politics and poetry, this thesis demonstrates the need for a decolonial practice in the art of cinema.","This research takes stock of archaeozoological investigations to this day in Auvergne and Languedoc (France), two regions still lacking a synthetic account of available material of the transition between Antiquity and the Middle Ages. It relies on analysis of 155 000 fauna remains recovered mainly from 39 rural sites dated from the 4th to 8th centuries AD. The faunal material has been split in 460 groups, called chrono-stratigraphic samples. They serve as a foundation for the estimate of each species\u2019 status, dietary habits and waste management. These case studies have provided evidence for a synthetic theory of the production and consumption of animal resources, the better to understand how rural communities of the time and localities cared for their livestock.The synthesis begins with a osteometrical analysis of domestic animals, shedding further light on the acknowledged but poorly-documented phenomenon of progressive size decrease in bovines, caprines and pigs. Further studies help single out unique local swine forms between the Languedoc and Auvergne regions, along with two asinine forms which indicate the incoming and predominance of a small shape during the Late Antiquity in southern France. The wide range of canine bones dimensions give information about a wide variety of shapes in domestic dog, while the wide size range of feline bones equates to the joint presence of domestic cats, wild cats and Iberian lynxes. Bone study then focused on identifying origins and function in order to classify avenues and methods of release from animal waste. A variety of practices for butchering, cooking and consuming the flesh, was thereby uncovered through a taxonomic and anatomical classification, providing grounds for a diachronic and interregional analysis of meat diets and pastoral practices in the area under study.Despite localised variations, animal husbandry and trade of animal goods seems to have undergone coherent, regional change across the area under study, with a notable increase in caprine populations throughout the Late Antiquity followed by a renewed rise in bovines and a progressively higher average age for herd animals as exploitation and trade of flat oysters ceased. These are but a few examples of a constant evolution of the methods and practices for exploitation of animal resources, an evolution which would suggest that progression toward a medieval model was far from linear but rather underwent oscillating cycles, testifying to the vitality and adaptive qualities of rural populations.","In the al-\u2019I\u0161\u00e2r\u00e2t al-\u2019il\u00e2hiyya \u201c Divine Signs \u201c of Abu Hayyan At-Tawheedy, the Spiritual discourse lies between a deep visioned sign and a glamorous register. This towering figure of the late 4th century Hejira\u002f 10th century AC, was a novelist, philosopher, ascetic and Sufi (mystic). He started with a preaching ascetic discourse that revives the soul; not a traditional Hagiography. It was a fruit of a personal experience hard in its dimensions about himself and the universe. He, eventually, concluded that salvation can\u2019t be attained unless a sublime exaltation occurs first. To such a discourse, he devoted a structure, based on \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdrefining morality and purifying the soul\u201c, as an essential feature to elaborate the spirit towards a mystical experience manifested by apparent spiritual rituals but within inner divine signs. Such a masterpiece was, thus, one of the symbols of Sufi literature. This was the process of the book and a part of its particular view on Man from the cradle to the grave.","Judicial measures of foster care in child protection impose the separation of a child from his environment of origin. A link with the social institution where the child is entrusted is then created with, at the center of a complex and dynamic environment, a relationship: one between a child and a social worker who has become his\u002fher referent. This thesis work questions the singular characteristics of this relationship with specific outlines. The methodological approach mobilizes a socio-historical approach to child protection and social work embodied by the profession of social work assistant and a socio-institutional analysis of the affected service. It is associated with the doing of an ethnographic survey including participant observations of a researcher using the concept of involvement and the conducting of about fifty semi-structured interviews with children, young people, parents and professionals. Results have made it possible to model the knowledge, practices and educational styles of those who \"are the reference\" in this extraordinary daily life. They also recall, through the words collected from the child, the conditions that would allow him\u002fher to be placed in a real educational space in social work: permanence ethics, appropriation of individual history, protection of links and mutual recognition of the active subjects.","In this thesis, I develop an account of singular concepts, those we use to think directly about particular individuals. Building on the work of other philosophers, I identify singular concepts with mental files. Yet the way I flesh out this proposal significantly departs from philosophical tradition. According to the received philosophical view, any representations that satisfies a certain a priori task analysis counts as a file. I object that this renders the notion useless in distinguishing between genuinely singular thoughts and merely descriptive ones, and that it precludes files from playing any substantive explanatory role. I put forward an alternative conception of files as a cognitive natural kind, firmly rooted in empirical research. I propose that we think of singular concepts\u002fmental files as representations suitably related to object files \u2014 a type of representation initially posited by vision scientists, that has since received independent support from other areas of cognitive science. Being singular percepts of objects, rather than concepts of individuals, object files alone cannot explain the full range of singular thought, however. To address this challenge, I outline a novel 'sorted files' model of core cognition, as composed of multiple subsystems of domain-specific representations of individuals, and explore paths leading from preconceptual singular representations to full-blown singular concepts.","The hospital is a world that is both sensitive and complex, sensitive because the human life is involved and complex because medical facilities are growing in number and in technical complexity. Then, the problem of the medical equipment maintenance in order to keep them in safe, reliable and with high level of availability has become a major preoccupation of the hospital. The objective of this thesis is to provide tools to help the biomedical maintenance service of the hospital to make decisions that allow a better control of costs, while ensuring patient and user safety and maintaining optimal performance of medical equipment. First, a heuristic has been proposed for the choice of internalization or outsourcing maintenance and for the selection of the appropriate contract. The selection of the contract is based on a set of criteria while considering the available budget constraint. Then, to improve the proposed procedure, we proposed multi-criteria decision-making tools to select the appropriate maintenance strategies. Seven criteria have been designed to study the criticality of medical equipment and the choice of maintenance by providing a coupling of the AHP approach \"Analytical Hierarchy Process\" with TOPSIS technique \"Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution.\" As the expert judgments of the maintenance department presented some uncertainty, we integrated the fuzzy language assessment of the criticality of the equipment and the selection of the maintenance strategy (Fuzzy AHP coupled with Fuzzy TOPSIS). A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) was developed to define thresholds of criticality to characterize the three maintenance strategies. According to these thresholds, maintenance cost can be optimized within the available budget. Finally, a second mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) was developed based on the proposed heuristic. This model allows selecting for each equipment, the maintenance strategy, the internalization or the outsourcing of the maintenance and the type of contract while considering the available budget and the workload \u002f capacity of the maintenance department","This thesis investigates the effects of corruption, asymmetric information and gender on discouragement. Specifically, we answer three questions: Does corruption impact the demand for bank credit in Asian developing countries? Does credit information sharing reduce discouraged borrowers? Does corruption discourage more female entrepreneurs from applying for credit? Using the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank from 2011 to 2018, we find not only the significant effects but also the mechanisms to explain these effects. First, corruption has a negative effect on discouragement in developing countries. Moreover, this link varies on the level of country development. In more developed countries (resp. less), firms are more (resp. less) discouraged from applying for credit when perceiving higher corruption. The burden of government regulations is a channel to explain the above opposite effects. Second, information sharing through public credit registries mitigates discouragement. However, sharing information through private credit registries has a non-linear effect on discouragement. A low (resp. sufficient) coverage of the information diminishes (resp. enhances) the demand for bank credit. Third, perceiving high corruption, female entrepreneurs are more discouraged from applying for loans than male entrepreneurs. Three mechanisms are found to explain this result: (1) women suffer more from corruption than men do; (2) women have less experience in dealing with corruption; (3) the degree of gender equality influences the gendered impact of corruption with greater discouragement for women in a less gender equality society.","The renewal of documentation about the preventive archaeology dynamism, as well as the systematic recovery of datas from old or unpublished excavations have resulted in a fresh perspective at the Middle Bronze Age of the upper Rhine\u2019s south plain. The corpus, joined in this work, gives varied datas (metallic, resinous objects, pottery), from various sources (settlements, graves, deposits, isolated objects), which is not limited to Haguenau\u2019s cemeteries, anymore. Metallic materials and pottery had been examined individually. The determined typology, combined with statistical analysis show seven stages since the end of the Early Bronze Age (BA III\u002fBz A2b) to the beginning of Late Bronze Age (BF 1\u002fBz D2). The middle phase of the Middle Bronze Age (end of BM I-beginning of BM II\u002fBz B2-C1) remains uncleared and seems not to be in the Upper Rhine. The correlation with well-known absolute dates in the Upper Rhine comes to a time interval between 1600 and 1300 Before J-C, approximately. During the first stage, the interactions are located in the South of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in the Swabian Alb and in the western Switzerland. Then, interactions continue to intensify, become more diverses towards the North, near the Middle Rhine.","In this dissertation, we focus on the various uses of mono (thing, object) in contemporary Japanese. From a methodological point of view, we have adopted an approach based on the observation of authentic data which we have analyzed under several syntactical, semantic and enunciative criteria. Samples consist of various aspects of modern language (newspaper articles, contemporary novels, internet-based communication, informal conversation) collected from existing data sources, mainly from the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) and the Nagoya University Japanese Conversation Corpus.We have first attempted to identify and describe referential readings compared to other more functionnal uses. For this purpose, we have investigated the concept of  \u2018formal noun\u2019 (keishiki meishi) of which mono is seen as a prototype.The second part is dedicated to the form 'A-wa C-MONO da' that particularly caught our attention because of its frequency and its enunciative effects. A first approach concentrates on nominal uses realized within the framework of a nominal sentence (meishi jutsugo bun). In this part, we propose a brief summary of research on nominal predication and present the different meanings of the sentences built around the bare noun mono. In a second approach, we consider it from the point of view of nominalization, where mono da can be seen as a purely enunciative operator. For this analysis, we have developped a theorical model based on Nishiyama (1985), Kudo (1995, 2002), Teramura (1984, 1999) and Morita (1989).In the third part, reference to the notion of modality has allowed us to specify the appreciative or epistemic nature of the judgment. We have also analyzed the function of mono as a discourse connector in journalist papers and shown its contribution to argumentative operations. The pragmatic approach highlights the process that drives the emergence of specific values derived from its underlying meaning of 'general tendency.' This work ends with an attempt to put the various uses of mono in perspective from the point of view of grammaticalization.","After World War I, there was a crisis of characters representation in French literature. It was based on a philosophical and epistemological uneasiness about the status and role of individual. In such a context, the fictional work of Victor Serge offers an original alternative to the question. Serge is simultaneously witness and actor of the Russian revolution and literature richness of the first revolutionary years. As he opposed to Stalin and survived the gulags, he is indeed the only writer of the revolution who could express himself freely in the 1930s.\tThus, from a social and literary outlook, Serge offers us an overview of a new social literature: he had time to mature and to assimilate a new understanding of individual and collectivity role, resulting from revolution. He restores all that in his work.This thesis looks at the entire fictional work through the prism of textual analysis of making of characters. Character appeared as the matrix for the progressive construction of the novel - both the narrative medium of the story and its finality. Between fragmentation technique and epic impetus, the hero of Serge goes shared in individualized protagonist and collective actor. These two levels are linked and designed as objects of conquest.\tThis literature of praxis and combat is being watched through a work on the plural pronoun. An empty, indeterminate label, becomes -with writing- a Marxist comprehensive grid for collectivity. Serge's work then manage to build a collective hero who converts polyphonic multiplicity into a contrasted collective actor.Nevertheless, in last Serge\u2019s works, this prospect and literary innovation bumps into social reality of the 1930s and 1940s. Totalitarianism, the failure of a revolution, all this leads to a novel with no collective hero and therefore no individual hero as well. In Serge\u2019s work there is a correlation of them. This disappearance turns to become its own story and ultimately paves the way to different solutions: the plot presents archetypal characters or figures of discourse. Some individuals remain in the fiction by giving themselves a sur-human dimension, a mystical one.","The overall objective of this doctoral dissertation was to study the role of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) as a personal resource among French Air Force members, personnel subject to demanding work environments. The first study aimed at validating the French \u2013 Psychological Capital Questionnaire 24 (F-PCQ-24) and showed its good measurement invariance qualities across time and various biodemographic characteristics (e.g., rank, tenure). However, courage was not supported as an additional dimension of PsyCap. The second study revealed different contrasted PsyCap profiles, the latter showing specific relationships with critical predictors (e.g., rank, hardiness) and outcomes (e.g., organizational commitment). The third study showed that PsyCap partially mediated the relationship of role ambiguity and intensification of job demands with organizational citizenship behaviors and need for recovery. These three studies enrich scientific literature dealing with PsyCap in the work context. Moreover, they contribute to identify leverage actions to improve organizational practices that aim at reinforcing military staff personal resources, which in turn could help to maintain operational capacity of the French Air Force members.","Studying the constitutionalization of labor law as a contemporary dynamic implies considering not only the current dynamics of this movement but also its future dynamics. In the first place, labor law is full y part of a general process of constitutionalization of the different branches of the law. Labor law is therefore the subject of a constitutionalization. Labor law is also a source of constitutionalization as it is the source of constitutional recognition for several important civil rights and freedoms. Second, labor law is currently undergoing several evolutions which are likely to entertain close relations with the constitutionalisation process it is going through. Recent reforms tend to redefine labour relations. The relation between law and collective agreements is deeply revisited. These developments, because of the particular nature of the problems they raise, are likely to amplify the constitutionalization of labor Jaw. Several original questions are raised : collective negociations in the process of law-making, relations between supplementary provisions and legislative power, resiliance of the individual employment contract. At last, the orientations of labor law are changing. The constitutionalization of labor Jaw can help to define or redefine these orientations. More specifically, it can act both as an obstacle and a driving force in this definition.","More than fifty thousand processes of national reconciliation have been organised since the end of the eighties. Yet the outcome is still uncertain:  is reconciliation possible? The instances of extreme violence which emerged in the twentieth century seem to have created an insoluble paradox. On the one hand, we must accept reconciliation to avoid new massacres. (Doesn't violence generate more violence?) On the other, it seems more incongruous than ever to call for reconciliation. Who has the right to order a victim of genocide to agree to r conciliation? The underlying assumption in this work is that reconciliation never really works because liberal theory cannot conceive of violence, and, more generally, social sciences are unable to deal with violence. As a result, we have to understand the scientific storytelling produced by liberal philosophy and transitional justice. We can then oppose the storytelling to a \"philosophy of the concrete\" and a philosophy of detail, which draw on anthropology and history in order to grasp what we almost incidentally call violence.","The voice, in its acoustic essence, is the main signal of identity of an individual, it is a part of his social habitus. It shows his membership to a group, to a class, to a culture. The importance of vocal behaviour it was stressed by the Actio since ancient rhetoric and it resides in the capacity of raising or extinguishing emotions and attention; in the power of persuasion towards a big audience, or towards a single interlocutor. Voice is a means of contact, it reveals or it hides interiority, it is an instrument of self or of social control. This research concerns the vocal imagination during the years between 1830 and 1871, a period of strong political and social disputes. A period where mass communication starts his way, and with it, the importance of the persuasive effects of the voice takes an important place. This research turns its particular attention to a specific use of the voice: fictional conversations, in novels and operas, enjoyed by a large audience. Opera in Italy, novels in France and in Great Britain are the main instruments for divulgation of ideas and for promotion of patterns of behaviour, thanks to their diffusion in that period. These texts deal with the role and functions of the voice, and discover social relations and the interpretation of the reality traced by the authors. Especially when they are national monuments like Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Verdi and Charles Dickens, who live in a post-revolutionary historic context, in Countries having different social and economical structures, and different relations with 1789 events. The key-concept of this research is the interstice role played by the voice in a written text. Through it, very important (and conflicting) information may appear, concerning the interpretation of the reality advanced by the author, outside his same conscious control about emotions and exercise of power, inside and outside the plot dimension. Among the characters, and between authors and public. The first part considers the vocal habitus; the power relations, the \u201cright\u201d and the \u201ccensured\u201d emotions; the degree of opening or closing of a communication. In the protagonist-speaker (with his credibility, his ethos) and in the main characters involved in speeches with a symbolic significance, in affection context (partners and parental relationships) and authority context (sovereign-subjects). The second part analyses the role of voice-sound towards the other elements of persuasion: pathos and logos, and especially the problems prompted by the protagonists as orators in their performances in the main point of the text (exordium, end, speeches where the character fights for his destiny). This research pays attention to the Actio, and to the \u201cdecorum-prepon\u201d, to their effects on the characters inside the plot, and outside of it. So, the significance given to the resonant words can emerge, a paradoxical form of written orality, or \u201coralized\u201d writing in XIX century society.","This research is concerned with the historical evolution between 1949 and 2000 of \"responsibility accounting\", an official name of management accounting in China. The aim is to better understand the nature of management accounting change in response to the social and economic changing in recent years. Our historical research shows, while keeping the organizational structure based on teamwork, the content, parameters and indicators of \"responsibility accounting\" in China have changed in order to serve the political needs. Despite similarities with Management by Objectives and \u201cmethod of Bat'a\u201d, the \"Chinese accounting responsibility\" has two characteristic features: a strong government intervention and a responsibility collective. Its historical evolution suggests the management accounting is a product of social relations; it is a link between institutional values and behaviors of the individuals. Our research shows also the management accounting can be a catalyst for the enthusiasm of workers and contribute to the organizational performance. The instruments of management accounting don\u2019t necessarily need to be complicated but should to be adapted to the organization by taking into account the various elements of the culture, economy and society.","The work presented in this thesis aims at analysing the burials of equids in the cemeteries of the Avar period in the south-eastern part of ancient Roman Pannonia. The main issues of this study are the restitution of the process implemented for the burial of equids and that of the \"funeral programme\" in its religious, cultural and social dimensions. This restitution is essentially based on the analysis of the remains in place, using in particular the archaeo-thanatological method and the tools of taphonomy. The territory under consideration has the advantage of being at the crossroads of varied cultural influences: the Germanic area, the Mediterranean world and the Steppic inputs. The interpretation discusses the semiology of funerary practices, particularly through the notions of sacrifice and \"accompanying death\"; it questions the paradigm of the \"nomadic horseman\" in order to reintegrate this practice into the European context of the early Middle Ages and to propose a cultural hybridisation; finally, it questions its elitist character through the notions of wealth, social status and prestige, among others by placing its manifestations in a topographical analysis of funerary practices.","Absenteeism is a current phenomenon of concern to many organizations and affects both the private and public sectors. The public hospital sector is particularly affected. The absenteeism rate can be as high as 14% (Brami et al., 2014). These figures are alarming and have been rising steadily over the years. Numerous studies have been conducted to find the origins and causes of absenteeism, but very few deal specifically with how absenteeism is managed and its consequences. Throughout our research, we have been interested in how absenteeism is managed in the limited budgetary context posed by New Public Management, and we wanted to observe the influences of relations between leaders and subordinates in such management. In fact, what does the nurse manager do when he or she learns that a nurse will be absent for a short, long or very long time? First, we studied the influences of the relationships between leaders and subordinates in the use of these absenteeism management modalities, at two distinct levels. On the one hand, the relationships between nurses (subordinates) and nurse managers (leaders) are studied. On the other hand, the relationships between nurse managers (subordinates) and senior nurse managers (leaders) are studied. However, consequences of the use of these absenteeism management methods on the health of both nurses and nurse managers are analysed. The consequences on patients are studied indirectly through the perception of the quality of staff care. The current management of absenteeism also has an impact on presenteeism, an emerging concept that needs to be clarified throughout this work.","Immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often exposed to periods of precariousness after arriving in France and are also one of the most affected populations by HIV and HBV infections. The aim of this thesis was to study the access to care of SSA immigrants according to their HIV or HBV status. The ANRS-Parcours survey was conducted among 2,468 SSA immigrants living in Paris area and the Barom\u00e8tre sant\u00e9 2010 among 27,653 people living in France. The Parcours survey used a biographical grid to collect indicators year after year analysed with a discrete-time logistic regression method. Sub-Saharan immigrants have access to health insurance coverage the year they arrived in France, but one in ten still did not have one three years after their arrival (more often in the absence of a permit of residence). They are more exposed to unmet health care needs than the rest of the population in France. This finding is aggravated by refusals to provide healthcare for participants covered by the specific health insurance for precarious or undocumented migrants and people living with HIV. The linkage to care takes place the year of the diagnosis. The likelihood of applying for a medical residence permit was higher among participants living with HIV. Social situations, which can change over time, affect the ability of immigrants to access health care. In the context of immigration, these social situations differ according to the reasons and conditions of arrival in France, depending on the status of the stay in France (having or not a residence permit, the right to work ...) and the way in which it evolves.","European regulation has a real impact on the granting of public aid to companies in difficulty. It mainly frames this one in the maize but to guarantee the respect of the competition on the internal market. This aid is then implemented by the rules of internal origin, which specify the methods of intervention of the local public authorities. Discrepancies can be observed between texts and practice.Since the legalization, in 1982, of the economic intervention of these communities in favor of the companies, their role has been transformed and strengthened. This evolution has been facilitated by decentralization reforms having their interventions. The most recent date of 2015 (NOTRe law). Also, because of the different successive economic crises that France is experiencing. This, without doubt, justifies the number of actors who question themselves. Today, the law OUR place is \"lock\" the situation in agreement with the region the right jurisdiction to help companies in difficulties. However, some subregional communities are allowed to participate in the regional intervention.","Gr\u00e9ard held numerous positions. He was an academic inspector for the Paris school district in 1864, an inspector in charge of primary instruction in the same school district in 1866, the Director of Primary Education for the Departement of the Seine in 1870, the Inspector General of Public Instruction in 1871, and the Director of Primary Education at the Ministry of Public Education in 1872. On October 11, 1873, Gr\u00e9ard left the ministry following a campaign of slander that tarnished his reputation. Nevertheless, as of 1879, Gr\u00e9ard was considered to be the main architect of the new pedagogical organization of primary education. His education plan was based on what was known as the simultaneous mode. Its main characteristics were the organization of grade-level instruction, the grouping of students according to their level, the monitoring of classroom teaching, the setting up of standard curricula, and the creation of the exam for what became known as the \u201ccertificate of studies.\u201d As a practically-minded man, Gr\u00e9ard visited schools, conducted studies, and sought to measure difficulties experienced by teachers. With the support of Jules Simon, Gr\u00e9ard opened two secular normal schools: one for male primary schoolteachers in October 1872, and the other for female primary schoolteachers in January 1873. These normal schools disseminated the intuitive method. Gr\u00e9ard had significant financial backing and oversaw the construction of a number of schools. For the first time, a school designed especially for apprentices was built in the capital. Other initiatives followed, including the creation of upper primary schools in Paris as well as the development of vocational and adult education. Intellectually sophisticated, a writer, an academic, and university vice-rector in 1879, Gr\u00e9ard used his pedagogical talents as a member of the High Council of Public Instruction and when participating in numerous committees. In 1882, his reform took on a national dimension, and schoolteachers began affiliating themselves with it at teachers' conventions. As an advisor to ministers, he played an important role in defining the educational policies under the Third Republic for twenty-three years. In the prestigious Academy of Paris (made up of nine departments), his contributions to education were unanimously respected. In 1902, the major reforms were completed and implemented.","A finance lease arrangement is a financing technique whereby the financial lessor acquires ownership of a property for the purpose of leasing it to the lessee who has a call option at the end of the irrevocable rental period. In the event that a collective procedure is opened against the lessee, the financial lessor is necessarily affected. The firms in financial distress rights offers the competent body the possibility of requiring the financial lease arrangement\u2019s continuation, with no consideration other than the contract\u2019s execution under its initial conditions. It is also possible for the court to require the financial lessor to transfer its contract when a disposal plan is considered. The financial lessor must also ensure the preservation of its interests by reporting, like any other creditor, its accounts payable arising prior to the opening judgment, while a second declaration of claims may be necessary where appropriate, when the contract is continued beyond the opening judgment. As the owner of the property, subject of the credit agreement, the financial lessor nevertheless has a real opportunity of being disinterested of part of its receivables. However, its owner status must be opposable to the insolvency proceedings. Property as well as the lease are, in this context, diverted from their natural roles. The financial lessor\u2019s ownership is then limited to the transaction\u2019s guarantee, which leads to establish a parallel between the title retention clause and the trust by way of security.","By its very positioning, the Court of Justice has always had to convince the legitimacy of its decisions. This quest for authority has led it to develop an argumentative strategy that focuses on the continuity of its case law. The argument of jurisprudential continuity is thus asserts through several argumentative tendencies - self-referentiality, distinction, implicit overruling, reasoning by analogy, the formation of jurisprudential lines, etc. - and the use of the principle of the continuity of its jurisprudence. - converging towards a common purpose, making the decision acceptable by placing it in the wake of pre-existing interpretations. Generally speaking, the argument of jurisprudential continuity can therefore be defined as an argument invoked in order to justify the validity of the interpretation delivered by its extension with previous jurisprudence. The purpose of this study is to identify the influence of continuity as a rhetorical argument explicitly used by the judge in the reasoning of his decisions, in particular through reference to his own precedents, but also the authority that the Court's precedents and, more generally, the body of case law exert on the formation of law by the judge. The continuity argument is indeed a powerful indicator of the way in which the Court develops its case law and how it intends to develop it. These questions finally lead to the observation that, if the argument of jurisprudential continuity is both a powerful factor in the legitimacy of decisions and a source of coherence, above all temporal, of the jurisprudence, it also limits the judge's field of reflection and impoverishes it.","China's swift economic development and share in global trade increasing rapidly imply a need to understand its inflation dynamics with internal and external pressures. While recent papers focus on inflation process analysis in the mainland of China by using a country-level data (see, e.g. Brandt & Zhu, 2000; Feyzio\u011flu & Willard, 2006; Porter, 2010), less attention has been paid to differences across China's jurisdictions. Thus, understanding of inflation dynamics and its interaction among the Chinese provinces are the important issues for central bank's monetary policy decisions. Firstly, considering the internal and external inflation pressures, I analyze the inflation dynamics among the CMU (Chapter 3). Secondly, because of the free flow of goods and internal migration across the country, I'm interested in analyzing the effect of inflation interaction among its provinces with internal and external pressures (Chapter 4). Finally, we combine the interest in the provincial variation in China's inflation dynamics with its characteristic of economic openness by estimating hybrid open-economy Phillips curves for the Chinese provinces(Chapter 5).","We studied in this work the concrete ways in which are expressed the relations between the power and the theater in the seventeenth century, when this art was already associated with the principle of mass distribution which allows it to flourish regardless of patronage. As the theater is both a practice and a literature, our investigation was conducted in two stages. We are primarily interested in professional actors, most of whom have formed theatre troops bearing the name of a powerful man. This reality seems a priori obvious is nevertheless revealing. The history of the Royal troupe of H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne is a prime example. Other smaller companies maintain also close relations with their protectors. This is for example the case of the theater troop of Great Cond\u00e9 that we studied. But most of the time, these touring companies are not close to their patrons. Rather, they are in contact with other bodies of power, especially the municipal power. Thus the first part of our work ends with two case studies on Dijon and Brussels, two favorite destinations of theater troops. After studying the actors, our investigation continues by focusing on playwrights. The question of relations between playwrights and patrons is part of a vast subject that is the literary patronage in general. We tried to illustrate it through the example of the patronage of Richelieu, preceded by a preliminary inquiry into the question of dedication who served our whole second part.","The member countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) have been facing enormous development challenges for decades. Regarding this situation, and being aware of the key role of science and innovation in the creation of wealth, value addition and jobs, the WAEMU countries have deployed various mechanisms to mobilize research to contribute effectively to the fight against poverty and to resolve major challenges. This has led to an increase in the phenomenon of the valorization of research results in recent decades in the different countries of the region. However, it is clear that despite the multiplicity and diversity of actions and initiatives undertaken by different actors, the results of public research, in all fields, are still not well known, valued and used by the general public in this sub-regional area. This thesis, therefore, addresses the issue of valorization of public research results in the WAEMU region. It aims at identifying the various bottlenecks and dysfunctions that undermine the current system of research and valorization of research results and suggesting appropriate mechanisms to increase its effectiveness. The thesis is organized into two parts. The first part analyses the system of valorization of public research in force in the member States of the Union.  The second part, it outlines proposals for adapted valorization mechanisms in order to make research a springboard for socio-economic development in the WAEMU member states","In various fields, including literature, much work has been done on the question of space over the last few years and decades. Some refer to a \u201cspatial turn\u201d in humanities and social sciences. However, in spite of a considerable general interest in this topic, the notion of space remains equivocal. The term is commonly used to denote basic facts in geography, urbanism and astronomy, but the concept is also often said to be rather complex. Husserl claimed that space was both a \u201ccontent\u201d and a \u201cform\u201d, while Einstein believed that its genuine nature was at the same time \u201cobscure\u201d and \u201cundeniably objective\u201d. In this thesis, we take into account the complexity of the space itself and challenge the notion of spatiality in literature. The corpus consists of novels and narratives written by V.S. Naipaul, Martin Amis, Jean Echenoz, Fran\u00e7ois Bon, Radoslav Petkovi\u0107 and David Albahari. Spatiality, such as defined here, brings us to examine both content- and form-related issues, including urban and non-urban space, spatial \u201cpolarization\u201d (\u201ccenters\u201d and \u201cperipheries\u201d, \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, \u201cknown\u201d and \u201cunknown\u201d places), border, toponymy and topography. The use of some terms specifying spatial location (such as deictics) is also analyzed, as well as the iconographic representations of space referred to in the texts and, finally, different forms of self-reflexive discourse inherent in the writing of space. The analysis reveals that every level of spatiality has an essentially dynamic, non-static quality, as the elements that it is composed of are in constant opposition and interaction.","The concept of stress has become an object of scientific thought, which for many years has been a popular success with the general public. So stress has become an object of common sense thinking. It is this object within the framework of the work, that we have studied in an exploratory research using a questionnaire that we have elaborated, in a psychosocial approach and Social Representations which purpose is to explore the existence of Social Representations of workplace stress in the workplace, of its variations according to sex, both in and part of the dynamics of the hierarchical relations that structure the company (upward and horizontal comparison) in a normal and substitution context, also to explore the existence of social values of work stress as well as practices considered to be most effective in coping with work-related stress, and also psychological effects according to MBI dimensions. The results we present here would reveal the existence of an organized field of representations of stress at work and also the existence of symbolic relationships between hierarchical statuses and between men and women.","This thesis suggests describing, analyzing and understanding, in the clinical didactic background, the practice of class of elementary school teachers during some sessions of teaching disciplinary integrating content relating to the health education. The mobilized abstract notions lean on the fundamental principles of the didactics: the threefold approach, the didactic contract in articulation with the psychoanalytical postulates of the unconscious and the division of the person. The questioning gets organized around the following axes: (1) locate the \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0-l\u00e0 d\u00e9cisionnel\u201d in approaches to health education; (2) observe and understand the singularity of the person in the original versatility composition which he creates; (3) understand and describe the links which become established between the taught knowledge and the various components of the \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0-l\u00e0 d\u00e9cisionnel\u201d; (4) envisage the unconscious phenomena in the work in class during the process of transmission-appropriation of contents in health education. The methodology leans on three time of the clinical didactic approach. The interview of \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0-l\u00e0\u201d informs about the intentions, the conceptions, the experiences of the person. The \u201c\u00e9preuve\u201d is an observation in situ of the ordinary practices of class. The interview in the \u201capr\u00e8s-coup\u201d is a phase of confrontation of the hypotheses of the researcher with the point of view of the teacher. The results present two very contrasted cases, which teach the health education with different approaches and present two original compositions testifying of the singularity of them \"d\u00e9j\u00e0-l\u00e0 exp\u00e9rientiel\". The numerous divisions to which they are subjected oblige them to compose, at the risk sometimes of certain dishonest compromises.","This thesis analyzes water management dynamics in a semi-arid Brazilian region, in a context where public intervention mechanisms are changing. Following an ethnographic approach, the ways in which three rural communities adhere to the implementation of water conveyance infrastructures were compared, as well as the social immersion of these technical devices. The administrative bodies present the water supply systems as opportunities for rural communities to access drinking water and to emancipate from clientelism relations. Indeed, in this arid area, water resource has historically been handled by few, who have always used drought to sustain their own influence. Although the water supply infrastructures make the families\u2019 living easier, analysis shows that these technical devices remain external to the private sphere. Indeed, the social dynamics that these devices trigger are still embedded into clientelism relations and thus require specific know-how, that not everyone is equally able to deal with. This does not easily support a collective organization within the communities. In terms of water management, the technical device also triggers a transformation of the relation between people and water, less and less direct. Traditional practices for water-saving \u2013 together with broader, careful, resource management practices \u2013 are getting obsolete. Finally, the gap between the vision people have of the water resource and their actual individual practices makes it difficult for concerted management dynamics to arise at community level. Social changes brought by the implementation of water supply infrastructures also reveal that the administrative bodies adopt and follow a specific direction towards rural development that is defining in a normative way the role of rural communities and the modernity they should step into. These public authorities however do not have the resources to initiate local participative dynamics, nor do they provide the communities with the necessary resources to do so.","Learning in children with autism is a question that is often addressed through interventionsand load tap. Researches who try to evaluate the effectiveness of these actions havecontradictory results. In our research we will be interested in observational learning inchildren with autism. We will apply the protocol used by Jacqueline Nadel which lasts 9days After describing the characteristics of our sample and intervention.We will comparechildren\u2019s performance in this type of learning with neurotypical children. Then we willtest the effectiveness of a visual training on the performance of children with autism.Then we will evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on the motor development ofchildren with autism, and characteristics that may influence the improvement of motricityOur results showed that children with autism can learn by watching but not as good astheir neurotypical children performance visual training did not improve the performanceof children with autism because they need proprioceptive feedback during learning.Finally this intervention improved motor development of children with autism but theimprovement seems to be related to the intensity of autism","President Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) claims in 1946 that the U.S. should advance a \"faith-based\" diplomacy to encourage the spiritual reconstruction of a \u201cdechristianized\u201d Europe .To stand in the way of a Marxist and Godless Soviet Union, it has to begin with France, seen as the spiritual stone arch. More than in any other nation, the Marshall Plan brings a financial, economic and military support, willing to conquer hearts and minds. Many key governmental agencies are involved in this time period, while American churches engaged in aid relief are rediscovering France as a new mission territory. Usually strongly influenced by the religious conviction of the Presidents, \"Faith-based policies\u201d supporting Foreign policies are reinforced on the ground by the engagement of private voluntary organizations (PVOs). Formalized in 1998 by President Clinton as a tool in Foreign policy in the enactment of the Act on International Religious Freedom, this approach justifies the tenacity of missionaries from 1945 to the present day in a secular and catholic France. Encouraged by the Fourth Awakening, most American missions, mainstream Protestant churches, new religions like NRM (Mormonism, Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc...) and Evangelicals, welcome this mixed opportunity: a comeback for a few denominations already presents in the 19th century and for others a chance for a fresh beginning. Although the business of \"nation building\u201d, the reshaping of the economic and cultural life of France, is perceived by the American public opinion as one of the most disappointing of the post-war, a deeply transformed French society will later emerge. The overlapping of American public and private organizations, of American churches and missionaries lay the groundwork for the radical transformation of a French monolithic religious landscape. Without doubt this can be traced to this short and critical experimental period of the Early Cold War.","The present study aims to provide a carefully annotated translation of the second series of the Essays of Elia which appeared in English periodical magazines between 1820 and 1833. In order to be as complete as possible, this translation includes the passages removed by the author when they were published in book form in 1833. Particular attention has been paid to French translations of individual Elia essays scattered in mid-nineteenth century French magazines as well as to more modern translations of the collected Essays, up to the present day. The Last Essays of Elia was Lamb\u2019s final published work. It was very tempting to look for threads running through his work from the early writings to the LEE. In the critical introduction, we have sought to consider the various aspects of the work of Lamb, who was at the same time a poet, a journalist, a playwright, a theatre critic and a letter-writer before making his name as an essay-writer, breathing new life into the genre, thanks to the Elia persona. The fact that Lamb was a friend of the first English Romantic poets and that his life was blighted by his mother\u2019s murder at the hands of his beloved sister, brings a vivid interest to his work. An isolated figure of Romanticism, a \"very reasonable Romantic\" himself, a humourist in love with the books and language of the past, Lamb, though a relatively minor author, remains a key link to understanding the early nineteenth-century English literary scene.","Fetuses perceive speech sounds in utero in a relatively intelligible manner. Infants are therefore born with sophisticated speech abilities. However, newborns see faces talking to them. What brings the visual modality in speech perception at birth? Moreover, much adult research evidenced the strong involvement of the motor system in speech perception. Language would thus be not uniquely audio-visual, but rather audio-visuo-motor. What is the origin of the links between perception and visuo-motor aspects of speech? In a first series of studies, we tried to determine the impact of talking faces in newborns and the conditions that allow their recognition. In a second series of studies, we specifically studied the audio-visuo-motor link in speech perception and this, in two experimental conditions, either by using facial imitation in newborns, either with intermodal auditivo-visual situations in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old infants. In this way, we wanted to know if the infants\u2019 vocal experience could have an influence on the representations of heard vowels. The results revealed that the link between perceptive and motor aspects in speech perception are present already at birth, but that the phonological representations of memorized vowels are still fragile and become more robust as soon as the infant produce the vowel.","The history of justice in French West Africa was strongly marked by the jurisdictional activity of the Court of Appeal of French West Africa (AOF). Created by the Decree of 10 November 1903 on the reorganization of the service of justice in the colonies under the General Government of West Africa, this colonial higher court succeeded to the Court of Appeal of \"Senegal et d\u00e9pendances\". The Court of Appeal of AOF dealt with both civil and commercial matters, in misdemeanor and simple offenses, the appeal of judgments in first instance by the courts of first instance and justices of the peace with extended jurisdiction (JPCE). Litigation before the Court of Appeal of French West Africa relating to offenses against the persons and morals consists of a variety of offenses. The purpose of this study is to conduct an historical analysis of all these offenses appealed to the court for the period between 1905 and 1960. Specifically each category of offenses will be considered from the standpoint of law and custom. Jurisprudential solutions of the court will be analyzed. We will see cases in which the court advocating the application of local customs and situations in which it excluded to substitute the metropolitan law. Finally, this study will show the evolution of customs and law in this vast area of black Africa.","This thesis questions the role of mobility and how teenagers placed in institutional foster care move around, through a research conducted in four social care facilities (Maisons d\u2019Enfants \u00e0 Caract\u00e8re Social). Within the French child protection system (Aide Sociale \u00e0 l\u2019Enfance and Protection Judiciaire de la Jeunesse), this form of placement means that a minor is taken care of outside of her\u002fhis family home during a given period of time. This type of social care presents a significant spatial dimension, both in its objectives and ways of implementation. It is indeed based on two principles: it seeks to manage both distance and proximity to familiar spaces on the one hand, and the discontinuity and continuity between the inside and the outside of the facility on the other hand. Within this context, how teenagers move around and their mobility play a three-layered role. First, for the teenagers themselves: the foster care facility is their space of residence, and moving around makes it possible for them to deal with multiple spaces of belonging. Second, for the social workers: the facility is their working space, and they use mobility as a means to both handle relationships between themselves and the teenagers, and adjust the number of teenagers they work with based on group dynamics and other parameters. Third, at an institutional level: whether it is chosen or coerced, mobility allows the regulation between different norm systems but is not perceived as being valuable in and of itself.","Nowadays judges are indispensable actors: as guardians of fundamental rights and freedoms and as arbiters of the relationships between legal systems. They perform essential tasks which are not always easy to reconcile. This comparative study between the European Union and Canada is a depth analysis of interactions between a specific way to organise law (\u201cmultijuralism\u201d), a body (a supreme court), and specific rules (human rights). Indeed, theSupreme Court of Canada and the European Court of Justice are essential to accommodate a common legal order (in Canada or in the Europen Union) with the preservation of a certain legal diversity (between the Member States of the European Union, or between the provinces and the Indigenous communities of Canada). Then, they must ensure human rights, which involve a multilevel protection and complex ways to implement Canadian and European charters. However European and Canadian multijuralisms are modified since the structure of the human rights litigation and the way judges handle standards of protection tend to favor the unity and lead to homogenization. Nonetheless, substantial protection of fundamental rights in respect of multijuralism remains possible, as far as a pluralist and dialogical method is followed.","In my thesis, I will argue that computation as performed by computers is not merely a branch of mathematics but it should be also studied within physical sciences.More specifically, my work lies on the analysis of the concept of computation proposed by Alan Turing in 1936. This logical analysis is based on the mathematical model of modern computers, namely the Turing machine. The Turing machine is a computing model, which makes it possible to identify the theoretical limits of computers regardless of physical resources. Therefore the study of computers limits can be done directly from the Turing machine and regardless of their physical nature. However, some research conducted over the last few years suggest that the physical structure of computers is an essential part of the study of their theoretical limits. Such research may allow to build a critic to the current survey about a purely mathematical study of computation.Hypercomputation is exactly the concept at the heart of my thesis because it denotes computation that goes beyond Turing machine limits. In other words, even if Turing machine limits are regarded as computers limits, hypercomputation refers to the idea that it would be possible to compute more than the Turing machine; and it is precisely from physics where such possibilities come from.","This research purports to retrace the media and political history of Egypt, as a central element of Arab public space, within a wider regional framework constituted of peripheral countries such as Qatar, Kuwait or the Saudi-Emirati axis.It invites more particularly to a reflection upon the communicational politics at work under the respective governments of what can be called the \u201cRepublic of officers\u201d, a phrase borrowed from Yazid Sayegh to designate the successive takeovers of contemporary Egypt by military men, namely Nasser, Sadat, Mubarak, and finally Sisi.From the Arabist journalism of offensive resistance from the fifties\u2019 on, to the commercial development of media in the late eighties\u2019, a thorough examination of the informational and journalistic approach of the regimes in power will be undertaken. This will be linked with the diverse spheres of the public space, i.e. the intellectuals, religious, and all kinds of activists from the civil society. The role played by the cosmopolitical regime will be asked too, not as much as the transnational phenomenon of global pacification in Ulrich Beck\u2019s sense, but rather as this informal body is exploited and corrupted by the American administration and high European representation for not so altruistic aims.When Aljazeera channel was created in 1996, paving the way to a communicational neo-panarabism now promoted by a rentier micro-State of the Gulf region, namely Qatar, a new wind started to blow on the television treatment of political issues in the Arab world. The other countries of the peninsula soon responded, allowing the birth of an abundance of channels, most of which were commercial. The development of social networks and the new information technologies in general are not forgotten leading us to interrogate the mutations of this system which is getting more and more complex. In-between the scheme of co-isolation within which the evolution of the Qatari channel is inscribed and the counter-revolutionary project financially supported by the Saudi-Emirati axis after Morsi\u2019s election, then inaugurating an era of political absurdity permeating all and every interstice of the regional public space, our point will be to decipher more particularly the paradoxes of the system, in articulation with the notion of ethics and the concept of recognition.","The present dissertation explores the influence of cultural idiosyncrasies in the formulation and implementation of operations strategy. More specifically, through the consideration of distinct cultural factors argued to differ among human gatherings, the accommodation of operations is analyzed, in a way that the tensions between homogenization and flexibilization of productive practices and procedures shall be further addressed. Organized around three individual but complementary research articles, the dissertation explores then the relevance of aspects believed to be proper and \u2013 to some degree \u2013 segregational of national cultures, which shall be of particular interest to companies operating in foreign environments.Within this perspective, the first article builds on four of Hofstede\u2019s national culture dimensions (i.e. power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation vs. short-term) and on the High Performance Manufacturing (HPM) project\u2019s global database to assess the impact of the aspects of the Brazilian, Chinese, German, and South Korean cultures in the shaping of its companies\u2019 operations strategy. Relying on a confirmatory approach, results suggest that national cultures carry significant influences in firms\u2019 operations strategy processes. The second article further analyzes the influence of the Brazilian jeitinho, a cultural trait argued to be indigenous to Brazilian people and influent in the most diverse aspects of the functioning and organization of the Brazilian society, in business relationships. Within an exploratory qualitative approach, the assessment of semi-structured interviews conducted among Brazilian professionals suggest that supply chain relationships are indeed influenced by this cultural aspect, which may come to count with positive or negative connotations. Such understanding is believed to be of value to companies currently operating in Brazil or to those that intend to do so as part of their internationalization strategies. Finally, the third article is centered around the peculiarities and distinctions that French filmmakers bring to their creations to extrapolate lessons that can be learned from an international buyer-supplier relationship perspective. In this direction, a discussion is built over the difficulties of cultural adaptation, as well as over the value of cultural preservation and originality. Within this main debate, propositions to a more successful adaptation to national cultures are offered, which shall be of particular usefulness to companies seeking to expand their operations in international and culturally diverse contexts.","Considered as the power to impose his deliberate will in the settlement of a dispute brought before him, the judge's free will is an ambivalent formula. On the one hand, it triggers rejection because it reawakens the longstanding fear of the \"government of judges\" inherited from the monarchic culture. On the other hand, one cannot believe that the achievement of law through justice can be reduced to a mere mechanical activity leaving no room for the judge's will. This contradictory apprehension of the judge's free will results in an issue related to the value this free will should be granted. It has benefits : as a component of the art of judging, it impacts both the way the facts are approached and the way law is a applied. However, the judge's free will also has a darker side. It might shift and turn into arbitrary. The signs of the judge's arbitrary mobilise instruments for combating the threat, but none of them succeeds in eradicating it. Hence, free will is at the heart of a delicate balance witnessing the complexity of the function of judging.","The purpose of this thesis is to analyze an artistic work by using our factual experience in art, and to determine what are the colors in a painting, and to differentiate the manufactured color (what is not paint), from the artistic color (what is paint). My thesis is inspired by the madras material in the Caribbean area, and is based on my personal memories and experiences during my childhood. The pictorial work in painted \u002f unpainted dialectical relationship is based on the defiguration of the Madras structure, which is the support of the painting, and its deconstruction and reconstruction by the act of painting. It takes into consideration the issue of pictorial space and its redefinition in a broader sense : painted space, non-painted space, exhibition hall, real experience, inhabited space. Memory of madras artwork is a creation that was born from a social and cultural tear, a break with the local environment. It allows the creation of a new \"skin\", of a new mixed canvas, a metaphor, and in a sense, a relationship to the external world, and a way to look at the contemporary world, in the context of the globalization, and the broad international culture. By introducing a subtitle poetic of the relationship\u201d, my thesis is based on the thoughts inspired by the \"Relation\" of Edouard Glissant ; it also questions a number of concepts connected with the Creolization and miscegenation, such as : local culture, cultural identity, multiculturalism ; and finally, it poses the issue of miscegenation in Art and M\u00e9tis creation.","Fevers, climate and environment interacted with each other during the 18th and 19th centuries, generating deleterious effects on society, which had to adjust its health policies to epidemics, food shortages and shortages of drinking water. Between 1780 and 1821, the impact of the final phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the \"second hyperLIA\" (1815-1860) was strong in the Iberian Peninsula. The effects of these phenomena have repercussions on the environment due to the rapid succession of climatic alterations (droughts, floods, storms, hail) that characterize the final phase of the Mald\u00e0 Oscillation (1760-1800). Their consequences are combined with those of Dalton Minimum (1790-1830). These factors aggravate malaria, which is a persistent health problem in the Mediterranean and at European level. As an endemic epidemic, malaria would only be eradicated through the implementation of systematic public health policies to control the vectors of the disease. This thesis explores what these different variables do to the city of Barcelona and its region between 1780 and 1821. From an interdisciplinary perspective, its objective is to analyse how Mediterranean societies, from the point of view of health and historical demographics, have been able to react to climate fluctuations and the environmental disturbances they cause. Our main questioning takes into account the vulnerability of the Mediterranean environment in order to analyse how the combination of the climate, health and environmental variable introduces a break in an unstable configuration that pushes a society into crisis.","In this research, we study the process of recent changes that taken place in the Touat\u2019s space and society, changes that affect the oasis ecosystem and lead to a new relation between city\u002fcountry represented in the city of Adrar and his agricultural development. These changes are projected in one way or another on the oasis\u2019s agricultural land and the ksour\u2019s space, where the oasis is engaged in a large-scale economic and social openness. Therefore, it is experiencing strong population pressure that resulted from the recent increase of its population. These mutations are largely supported by state policy. The state plans will draw a new landscape of Sahara. In a n effort to create a territorial equity, the Saharan cities all have basic functions (education, health and administration) plus the planned housing programs, collective and individual similar to the north. Furthermore, given the richness of his basement, the Sahara is expected to contribute to the country\u2019s food independence. To this end, land reforms were introduced specifically to encourage the Sahara to adopt a new enhancement and move to new production techniques and irrigation. The main purpose of our study is to know: how far the state was able to redesign the space and the Saharan society? And to what degree these changes have affected the traditional habitat, the small food production and vernacular irrigation methods. And finally, did the state reached to control and verify the new forms of Saharan land?","This research has been developed in the framework of the project AMIS (Access to Multilingual Information and opinionS). AMIS is an European project which aims to help people to understand the main idea of a video in a foreign language by generating an automatic summary of it. In this thesis, we focus on the automatic recognition and translation of the speech of Arabic and dialectal videos. The statistical approaches proposed in the literature for automatic speech recognition are language independent and they are applicable to modern standard Arabic. However, this language presents some characteristics that we need to take into consideration in order to boost the performance of the speech recognition system. Among these characteristics we can mention the absence of short vowels in the text, which makes their training by the acoustic model difficult. We proposed several approaches to acoustic and\u002for language modeling in order to better recognize the Arabic speech. In the Arab world, modern standard Arabic is not the mother tongue, that is why daily conversations are carried out with dialect, an Arabic inspired from modern standard Arabic, but not only. We worked on the adaptation of the speech recognition system developed for the modern standard Arabic to the Algerian dialect, which is one of the most difficult variants of the Arabic language to recognize by automatic speech recognition systems. This is mainly due to the borrowed words  from other languages, the code-switching  and the lack of resources. Our approach to overcome all these problems is to take advantage from oral and textual data of other languages that have an impact on the dialect in order to train the required models for dialect speech recognition. The resulting text from Arabic speech recognition system was then used for machine translation. As a starting point, we conducted a comparative study between the phrase based approach and the neural approach used in machine translation. Then, we adapted these two approaches to translate the code-switched text.  Our study focused on the mix of Arabic and English in a parallel corpus extracted from official documents of the United Nations. In order to prevent the error propagation in the pipeline system, we worked on the adaptation of the vocabulary of the automatic speech recognition system and on the proposition of a new model that directly transforms a speech signal in language A into a sequence of words in another language B.","The duty to provide information and the duty to advise are in the forefront of the activity of insurance. The insurance is a very regulated economic branch: there exists a legislative and case law profusion. The protection of the future or current policyholder stays one of the major concerns of the legislator and the judges. The economic nature of the regulations of the insurance maintains a collective good between the various actors present on this financial services sector: the confidence. The purpose of the duty to advise is to maintain this confidence: in particular between the insurers and policyholders. This duty is the responsibility of insurers and all the actors proposing services of insurance, it is an eminently subjective notion, which is the resultant of a brain work leds by the person who proposes the subscription of an insurance contract. The content of the duty to advise is conditioned by the information exchanges realized between the different parts. The person who is charged to realise the duty to advise has, from the information which he collects on his prospect, to select the \"products\", which may respond to his demands and may adapt to his real economic situation. In the sector of insurance, the analysis of the duty to provide information and to advise varies appreciably according to the quality of the persons who make these duties. In insurance laws, these duties weigh, first of all, on the insurer and the intermediaries of insurances. Secondly, these obligations are on the charge of a multitude of persons, who propose the subscription of insurance contracts. Next, a major actor of the distribution of insurances services is the subscriber of insurances group. Insurances group are borned from the practice, and occupy henceforth a dominating economic place in the sector of insurance in France. The legal problems raised by the study of the obligations of information, warning and advice are different according to the individual or collective nature of the insurance contract. The individual contract of insurance offers to the insurance taker, a privileged interlocutor, the insurer. In a presentation of insurance transactions made by an intermediary of insurance, the applicant or \u002f and the insurant are then creditors of obligations of information on the charge of two different persons: the insurer and the intermediary of insurance. Unlike this \"classic\" plan, insurances group present a variety of contributors. Our study has for objective to treat the various legal problems concerned by the duty to provide information, the duty to warn, and to advise due to the policyholder in individual insurance, and in insurance group. The presentation of every obligation is a prerequisite in the study of its quality. The purpose of this study is to position on the coherence of the informative system established by the insurance contract law. Our study is essentially centred on the internal law, however the influence of the European directives on our study, as well as that of certain foreigners laws, cannot be evaded and will find place within our developments.","Since the 1910s, the reception of the French philosopher Henri Bergson among the mostly Francophone literary elite of the Ottoman Empire established his thought as a tool of the spiritualist reaction to the dominant positivist and materialist paradigm. While one of the first Ottoman readings of his work associated Bergsonian intuitionism with Sufi spiritualism, epistemological and disciplinary dynamics of the late imperial period created the conditions for its evolvement into a new psycho-philosophy. The War of Independence led by the future Ataturk in response to the collapse of the Empire during the First World War found expression in the review Dergah (1921-1923), which erected Bergsonism to the rank of a salvational philosophy. Alternative and spiritualist rationality, mobilization by the elan vital, and intuitionisn as a means of access to knowledge: the registers mobilized by Bergsonians constituted a psycho-philosophical epistemology seductive in times of crisis, which found its institutional counterpart in the Ottoman Darulfunun and during Republican times Istanbul University. After 1923, translations of Bergson accompanied a transposition of his philosophemes into the socio political field: nourishing a spiritualist yet secularized interpretation of the religious, they contributed to an alternative expression, described as conservative, of Kemalist republicanism and the political notion of time. This work questions, by means of the historicization of Bergsonian concepts, the modes in which the philosophical is envisaged as a discourse order that is actualized through epistemological, linguistic, institutional, religious or political shapings.","The data in this study was mainly collected using the participant observation method and was completed by interviews of policemen. It suggests that people who make a living on the street through illegal means do not get to choose who their business relies on. They often have to deal with anonymous encounters, provoked by opportunities they have little control over.To understand how the urban poor adapt to the noxious interactions that they are regularly confronted with, I will use the notion (borrowed from Nicolas Jounin) of the \u201cdisloyalty spiral\u201d. By this, I refer to social interactions characterized by distrust, in which some may see others behavior as disloyal, or at least problematic, and respond to it in a way that triggers another insidious reaction. The strategy of adaptation may consist of trying to escape the spiral ; or in other contexts, of simply not getting involved. In still other situations, the strategy of adaptation would be to play the \u201ctrickster\u201d or the \u201cfool\u201d all the way down. And in some cases, trying to dodge obvious forms of deception (like theft) may leave the door open to more subtle sorts (like unfulfilled promises of payment). These strategies of adaptation will be described in situations that involve dumpster divers, street vendors, their clients or the police.","Following the resumption of hostilities after the air Strike on President Habyarimana's plane, there was a violation of the ceasefire signed in Arusha (Tanzania) on 4 August 1993 between the Rwandan government and the rebellion of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , and a war Civil war broke out in Rwanda. During this civil war, many serious violations of international law were committed. As the various United Nations investigations found that these violations could be characterized as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, they recommended the establishment of an international criminal court to punish the perpetrators. Thus, the United Nations Security Council, having found that these crimes and the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda constituted a threat to the peace, created, at its meeting on 8 November 1994, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). He assigned him the task of prosecute all those involved in these crimes in Rwanda and in neighboring countries in 1994, with a view to contribute to the maintenance of peace in the African Great Lakes region and to national reconciliation in Rwanda.The legality of the creation of a criminal jurisdiction under Chapter VII of the Charter for the United Nations Security Council was analyzed. As to the adequacy of this measure to the context, the punishment of perpetrators should contribute to the maintenance of peace and national reconciliation through deterrence and the pedagogical aspect of judgments.However, at the close of the ICTR's work in 2014, the Office of the Prosecutor had not prosecuted any member of the RPF despite well-documented reports involving the crimes committed. Accordingly, no investigation has been carried out to elucidate the circumstances of the attack on the Rwandan president's plane, which the UN recognized as the trigger for the genocide.The ICTR's work has had legal limitations, based on both basic texts and the inappropriate prosecution strategy of the Office of the Prosecutor, and on the interference of Political factors that limited the work of the Office of the Prosecutor. These factors have made the action of the ICTR criticized and regarded by some observers as a justice of the victor.As a result of this partial and selective repression, the ICTR has not made any contribution to the maintenance of peace in the Great Lakes region. Impunity granted to members of a party to the Rwandan conflict has favored the export of armed violence to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where serious crimes have been committed since 1996. As for the contribution to national reconciliation, partial repression Has served rather to crystallize the frustrations that could, in the future, generate another political crisis more important than that of 1994.In order to remedy the errors of the ICTR, it was recommended that the international community, without extending the jurisdiction of the ICTR ratione temporis, could create another ad hoc international criminal tribunal to punish the perpetrators of crimes committed in Rwanda and Congo, and whose impunity risks perpetuating instability and violence in the region.","Prohibited two centuries ago, life insurance is now the mainstay of the Frencheconomy. At the crossroad of several legal areas, the study of life insuranceshould consider both the policy holder\u2019s and the beneficiary\u2019s families. Despite the fact that the French Insurance Code ignores, more often than not, familyrelationships, the legal rules applied to couples, heirs and creditors areinterfering with insurance law. So too do tax law and legal incapacities.Nowadays, life insurance plays a key-role in assets management and estateplanning. Several types of contracts are in use. New types of contracts, suchas universal life, annuities and unit-linked insurance plan, are savings vehicles.This evolution has completely renewed the life insurance market. Twocategories emerge among Life-based contracts. First, there are protection policies, which are designed to provide a benefit at the insured's death, such as term life and permanent life insurance. Investment policies are the second type. Their main objective is to facilitate the growth of a capital by paying single or flexible premiums ; they are the core activity of insurers. This study aims to assess the impact of this diverse range of contracts on family law. Articles L. 132-12 to 17 of the Insurance code were originally enacted to regulate term and permanent life insurance. It is a contradiction in terms to apply these provisions to the new types of contracts, which are pure savings vehicles. It was necessary to critically analyse how the Civil Code fills in the gaps left by the Insurance Code. Suggestions are made to adjust the legal regime to the wide diversity of life insurance contracts.","This dissertation is a cultural-history study of the building up of categories of belonging. The spatio-temporal context is the city of Alexandria between the late 19th century and the first third of the 20th. Being a field of confrontation between several cultural and political horizons (ottoman, Arab, European), Alexandria is a privileged field to study the notions of foreigner, Egyptian, ottoman, local, national, cosmopolitan as shifting categories, built-up by actors. In the aim of treating imagery as a historical object, these categories are investigated through a set of literary texts (in Arabic, French, Italian, English) produced by the actors of Alexandrian cultural life. By studying their trajectories, the sociability that emerges (or not) in Alexandrian literary milieus and the criteria on which literary reputations are built up, we can link the individual scale to a societal dimension. In conclusion, to extend the perspective, this dissertation proposes a socio-historical analysis of the survival or disappearance of these literary reputations beyond the space and time firstly considered. Analyzing the milieus in which an author reputation built up in the age of empires survives, or not, through the age of Nation-states, or from the colonial epoch to the age of decolonization, is offering an approach to the field of memory which is not based on nostalgic or ideological positions.","In a troubled social context by the impact of mass migration mixed with enthusiasm for the celebration of the First Centenary of the May Revolution in Argentina, Alfonsina Storni (1892-1938) joined an emergent Culture Industry. Her poems, chronicles, spoof letters and articles embodied her avant-garde thinking and her sense of parodying in the use of literature and commercial journalism. Storni was not just an easily accessible author who seduced crowds; as a poor woman, provincial teacher, and single mother, she was equally subjugated to the violent reality of Modern Buenos Aires. She explored writing as a path to self-knowledge, feminised resistance, and used first-person narrative to challenge misogynistic thinking, gender inequality and expected female stereotypes. Following her suicide, the media outlined a figure of her that echoed the irruption of catholic-nationalism and the rise of populist political culture with its own particular anecdotal and mythological reading of Storni.This study will look at Storni\u2019s performativity as part of first-wave feminism and how she was later portrayed in the persistence of Peronism through the various uses of its propaganda machine that, consequently, influenced a representation in a romantic and melodramatic light by the media, despite her strong feminist and socialist activism. Then, we will further look at the effects that Storni still has in a country where the feminist struggle against the androcentric culture tendencies and practises remains a constant feature.To show the complexity of Storni\u2019s appropriation over the decades by popular culture, it is essential to see Storni through her representations for \u2018analysing\u2019 and \u2018revealing\u2019 times of social change during the first half of the 20th century in Argentina. By doing so, we\u2019ll be able to shed light on aspects of her life as a committed woman with an intellectual creativity and cynical style that remained hidden by an ideologically-oriented archetypical characterisation.","This research investigates the residential anchoring of the Chinese internal migrants as part of their urban integration process. The prism of residential anchoring is a crucial entry point to explore the way in which internal migrants participate in the socio- spatial reconfiguration of urban space. That is especially due to the central role that the residential real estate market has been playing in the growth strategies of the Chinese \u201cDevelopmental State\u201d as well as to the economic and symbolic functions that housing covers for urban societies. Standing at the crossroads of human geography, urban geography and political sociology, this thesis takes as a case study the city of Zhuhai (Guangdong), where I carried out a two-year fieldwork investigation. The methodology relies on participant observation, ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews, and public policy analysis. I conducted interviews with more than 140 people, including 128 migrants, a dozen local officials, parastatal organizations, public developers, and local landlords. The analysis focuses on both formal and informal modalities of urban integration processes through a conceptual framework based on an \u201cintegrated definition of informality\u201d. The research findings shed light on a selective and highly competitive model of integration. This model, which reinforces the socio-spatial differentiation of urban space, produces interstices of informality. Within these \u201cgray spaces\u201d, low-skilled migrants develop their own residential and urban integration strategies, gaining sometimes access, albeit informally, to home ownership.","One of the most famous and acclaimed thinker of sixteenth-century Spain, Francisco S\u00e1nchez de las Brozas, Sanctius (1523-1600), has never been properly studied in a research work that would embrace his complete production and understand it in the History of ideas of his time. A teacher of rhetoric and Greek at the university of Salamanca, he published in a great variety of fields such as grammar, astronomy, poetry or logic. We offer to understand his works as structured by two main axes. First of all, Sanctius produces an important reflection on the three arts of the trivium in which he gives a specific emphasis on logic and turns it into a true art of thinking. Also, he develops several reflections around the concept of method to learn, reason and transmit the disciplines. To do so, he uses several intellectual criteria to ensure the accuracy of thinking: he is a thinker of method. Method is what he himself applies in all his demonstrations to give them legitimacy, validity and accuracy. But it is also a concept that expresses a will to organize and rationalize the disciplines. We thus aim at contemplating him at the same time as the teacher, the thinker, the humanist and the intellectual engaged in making his ideas be heard. By understanding Sanctius as a thinker of method, we follow a path set in History of ideas that aims at highlighting the importance of sixteenth-century philosophical humanism in the construction of fundamental paradigms of seventeenth-century thought.","Participation is normalizing in management and research practices, especially in environmental management and research. This trend founded this research in geography. Geoprospective is a way to collectively create spatial and long-term scenarios thanks to a large use of simulation tools. Moreover, it is considered as a mean to enhance environmental democracy. In this thesis, geoprospective is also considered as a mean to explore the contribution of space and time to the environmental democracy, in terms of power, knowledge, interactions between actors and models and social and political impacts of scenarios process. In order to test this hypothesis and for several other reasons (originality of spatial and temporal dimensions, centrality of power, hierarchy of knowledge), a geoprospective exercise has been applied to the fisheries of the Bay of Biscay.This exercise was based on a combination of participatory interviews and modeling. The materials and reflexivity analysis have shown that spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental democracy are multiwfaced. First, space and time lie in the transmission of knowledge. Then, space and time lie in the appropriation of models. In the end, space and time lie in actors narratives, play and imaginaries.","Joint control is the situation according to which several persons hold control of a company. Various definitions of the notion of joint control exist in financial law, corporate law, competition law and accounting law and have, a priori, a scope limited to each of these fields of law. Each definition is separately studied in order to identify its criteria, by relying on regulations, the practice of authorities and the case law. On the basis of these different functional definitions of joint control, a common definition can be found: \"joint control is an agreement according to which members of a company agree to determine jointly and equally the social strategy \". The main elements of this common definition are clarified. Joint control also raises issues relating to its legal regime. On the one hand, the scope of joint control is rarely defined because the texts generally refer only to control. It is proposed to determine the scope according to the purpose of the text. On the other hand, texts that refer to the notion of make provision of legal consequences without specifying how to implement these consequences to several controllers (joint liability, indivisibility or plurality of obligations). The rule of principle is the application of joint liability to the obligations arising from joint control.","One of the most characteristic expression of the administrative activities, the administrative decision is a familiar concept. Nevertheless, positive law on this subject turns out to be disparate and contingent. And behind a seeming consensus, the authors pre-sent the unilateral administrative actions with real terminological and conceptual disparities. The choice has been made to build a definition, from a critical analysis of positive law and doctrinal views, so as to test its merits with an eye to a better understanding of the Admin-istration and its law. Imperative meaning of a fixed and unilateral act of will of an adminis-trative body, the administrative decision is a useful tool to analyse the power of the Admin-istration, the judicial review of it and the place that citizens can aspire to in the process of its making and its implementation. Distinct from incitation or mere declaration of intent, deci-sion remains the preferred way of directing citizens behaviour and the main object of the judicial review of administrative acts. The explanatory impact of this definition is supple-mented by the understanding it enables of the strategical uses that actors of administrative law make of it. As a meaning, decision reveals the struggles they wage to identify, in a specif-ic case, the impact of the various acts of administrative bodies ; as a power issue, it brings out the strategies of legitimization that surround its use par public authorities.","This case study is a pretext to a theoretico-clinical thought process about more or less deliberate bodily mutilation. It is the borders or the limits which come into play, more than death precisely, as in a deliberate quest of death : on the contrary, these mutilations come from the process of identity survival and from a quest of self affirmation. Our hypothesis is that common aspect of certain body attacks, past the cultural phenomenon, is the lack of symbolization in preceding generations, which has in turn brought on trans-generational transmission, and from there we find the lack of ties, of limits, and the forbidding of even thinking these faulty ties. However this does not result, as is generally the case, from an unvoiced comment or the existence of a family secret, but rather from an ordeal, a psychic or physical attack of an ancestor that could not be symbolized. The attacks on the body represents a form of resistance to a deep attachment to trauma that seeks to consolidate the frontiers of the self. In addition, the resorting to the exterior of the body, inasmuch as it signifies sacrificial acts, from a historical perspective, is closely akin to certain forms of body art tattoos, body piercings but other types include scarification, branding, scalpelling. Recent developments in society, especially in the treatment of loss and destructiveness help to explain the current increase of scarification among adolescents.","This work tries to defend an objectivist theory of colour by a reconciliation of two theses generally considered as incompatible: physicalism, the theory that colours are scientific properties of objects, and revelation, the thesis that the nature of a colour is revealed by an experience of this colour. Those theses are considered as incompatible because colours are presented as qualities, while science is only about quantities. After a chapter about the history of the problem, showing how we can understand the modern controversy on secondary qualities thanks to the revelation thesis, I show how to understand revelation, distinguishing it from phenomenology, and claim that a correct theory of colour must support revelation.  After that, I argue that colours are transitory events, not standing properties: light produce colours, which are effects of the interaction of light with matter or, for primary light sources, events happening in them. This thesis gives a partial answer to some arguments against objectivism, notably variability arguments. Above all, this new categorization of colour reconciles the qualitative chromatic descriptions of colours with their quantitative physical descriptions, thus allowing reconciliation between the manifest and the scientific images of the world.","The collaboration between the CCJA and the national courts of cassation, in substance, takes place in the dispute of the Uniform Acts. It implements a judicial supranationality of the CCJA that manifests itself by its substitution to the national courts of cassation of substance raising issues related to the Uniform Act. It must be recognized that the complementarity between the collaboration between the CCJA and the national courts in the cassation appeal before the CCJA brings out different problems : an unconstitutionality of the Treaty even see uniform Acts in the process of integration, Concerns in the procedure upon appeal in cassation (no self-referral of the CCJA, no case of opening to cassation before the CCJA, the executory formula on the judgments of the CCJA), the evocation, the substitution of national courts of cassation, grounds before the CCJA, controversy in identifying the judge competent in the procedures of the AUPSRVE, the risks of conflict of competence and laws with regional organizations ( UEMOA). This collaboration continues between the state judge and the CCJA in arbitration, this is the mode of dispute resolution in the OHADA system, in the face of the ethics of arbitration. This mode of dispute resolution in the business mode no longer meets the criteria of the business world. Even though the OHADA arbitration is dual (ad hoc and CCJA), it is necessary to find ways in various law more adequate to address the various problems evoking for the business world.","The topos of Vienna as a \u201cbastion of Christianity\u201d emerged in the early centuries of the sixteenth century in the context of the Turkish threat, ever-present since the battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1526) and the siege of 1529. This leitmotif permeated the representations of the city but also urban pastoral for nearly a century. Although Reformation ideas found considerable success in Vienna, Hapsburg princes attempted to find a compromise shaped both by their admiration for Erasmus and the necessity of combatting the Sublime Porte. The Ottoman question prompted Archduke Ferdinand (1522-1564) and then his son Maximillian to adopt a politics of religious compromise concerning the Orders of Lower Austria which had largely sided with the Reformation. The financial dependence accrued by the prince on the Orders forced him to exalt the common Christian identity of his subjects however religiously divided they were. The unity demanded by regional mandates was disseminated by pastoral and spread by members of the established Church. Preaching became the vector of an adiaphoric Christian identity which reached its apogee in Vienna under Maximilian II. The coexistence which held until the start of the 1580s was nonetheless affected by the inevitable scandals that visited the urban community amidst clashes with the Ottomans and disputes concerning the calendar of the established Church. The devised compromise also fractured bit by bit on account of the increasingly virulent Catholic reconquest not to be activated until after the 1580s under the joint influence of the Jesuits, Bishop Kaspar Neubeck, and Archduke Ernst (1576-1592).","Artists's interests in biotechnologies date back from the 90's. Since then, numerous academic works focused on these interactions between art and biotechnology. By taking a closer look on works of arts conceived through the use of biotechnologies, we realize their impact in the work. How the use of new technologies demonstrates an evolution of the artistic perception of the living ? Opening the reflection on the living, understood as human beings, animals and plants, allows to take notice of an attempt to go beyond anthropomorphism while emphasizing the connection\u002fdependency between the other living beings and the human specie.                                                                                                                      The works of art are as many scenarios which, if not necessary relevant on a scientific level, allow to think about the issues raised by technologic developments. The wish to go beyond human limits, dreams of hybridization between human and machine, and the refusal of death feed the artistic imaginary. Through as selection of works from Art Orient\u00e9 objet, Wim Delvoye, Eduardo Kac, ORLAN and Stelarc, three big themes will be at the core of this reflection: death (and life), sex, and hybridization. The works will be analyzed through a formal, material and conceptual perspective. These elements allow us to emphasize the notion of flow in the interaction between art and biotechnology. Is the hybridization of knowledge, material, practices, shapes, which is visible in the aforementioned works, part of the new vision of the living being?","How can we alter and transform gender norms that negatively affect the lives of many women, as well as LGBTQ* people? This seeks an answer to this question by looking at the role of gender regulations and assignations in the reproduction of gender norms. Drawing on materialist, as well as queer and critical trans feminist perspectives, this project asks what collective challenges to structural and interrelational gender norms might be possible. Analyzing various moments where gender norms are imposed on subjects and demand that they take and keep their place within the gender binary (i.e., gender separate public spaces, gender markers on identity documents, or intersubjective categorizations) this research offers a systematic critique of social processes of gender regulation and their underexamined role in the persistence of gender hierarchies. From this critique emerges an underexplored feminist and queer strategy conceived as a politics of suspension seeking to alleviate the weight of gender norms in social life. The thesis outlines this strategy through a critical reconstruction of the concept of the neutral, drawing on an innovative reading of the work of French thinker Roland Barthes, echoing traces of this approach in queer, feminist and trans critical scholarships, as well as on contemporary architectural, social, and educational experiments. The goal is threefold: to characterize and theorize such a feminist and queer theory of the neutral, highlight its contribution to contemporary reflections on gender justice; and investigate its core practical, ethical, legal and political implications.","The purpose of this research is to describe and analyze the process of institutionalization and. Specially moments of this process: the exhibitions of knowledge. These moments are supported by teachers whose practices will be studied. The theoretical framework is that of the dual approach and the theory of didactic situations. What does \"expose knowledge\" at school mean ? This study is longitudinal and compares the practices of four expert teachers. It characterizes what it means depersonalization and contextualization of knowledge. To understand the conceptualization of rational numbers, this research is based on the anglo-saxon approach different from the french one. This allows to obtain interesting results. The study of classroom sequences led to analyze the writings intended to institutionalize knowledge (eventually few) as well as the times when this occurs orally. The features exhibitions of knowledge are different. The explanation for these differences leads to new questions about teacher training and the training of their trainers. The results raise the question of the joint resource development (professors, trainers and researchers) on the knowledge of teachers and the taught mathematics. These results involve additonal researches.","Does bank capitalization improve the performance and stability of commercial banks operating in the MENA region? This thesis aims to provide new evidences regarding the effects of capitalization on banks\u2019 behavior in the face of a difficult and unstable institutional environment. We start from the idea that poor institutional quality increases asymmetry of information problems which can affect the behavior of banks in terms of credit allocation and risk taking. The first chapter provides a multidimensional view of 17 countries in the MENA region, covering the economic, banking, and institutional context by using a macroeconomic and consolidated banking data. It highlights the economic and political instability of the region and the presence of high levels of corruption, poor government efficiency, and low regulatory quality, particularly when compared with advanced economies. The second chapter provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical literature related to the effects of capital regulation and the quality of governance on banks\u2019 behavior. It finds that despite 30 years of implementing capital regulations there is no consensus on the effectiveness of these regulations and their effects on banks\u2019 behavior. Moreover, few studies have considered the effect of institutional quality on bank behavior. For this reason, Chapter 3 proposes two separate empirical studies using Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimation. First, we study the effect of bank capitalization and institutional quality on the credit growth of 204 commercial banks operating in MENA countries during the period 2000-2017. Then, we study the effect of these factors on the stability of these banks measured by the Z-score panel data indicator in panel of Lepetit and Strobel (2013). Our result supports the hypothesis of the negative effect of capitalization on credit growth and shows that bank behavior depends not only on bank ownership (foreign-national banks; private-public banks) but also on the level of institutional quality of the countries where banks operate. Moreover, our results imply that increasing bank capital reduces bank stability. This contradicts the original objective of capital regulation, which was to reduce the risk of bank failure. Finally, Chapter 4 focuses on studying the cost efficiency of commercial banks in the MENA region, for a better understanding of bank performance. Cost efficiency is measured based on a nonparametric approach called the data envelopment approach (DEA). The empirical study shows that an increase in bank capitalization negatively affects the cost efficiency of banks operating in the region. The results of the last two chapters present the high cost of bank capitalization on the banking sector and suggest the need to take into consideration not only the nature of bank ownership but also the institutional quality and the development of countries.","This doctoral thesis studies the relationship between the textual form of collections of lyric love poetry in the Italian Middle Ages and the construction of the lyrical subject that animates this poetry. The focus is on the cases of Guido Cavalcanti (1258? - 1300), Dante (1265 \u2013 1321) and Petrarch (1304 \u2013 1374). The first provides an analysis of the Cavalcantian corpus and problematizes the absence of an author's collection. After defining the notions of the lyrical subject and analyzing the poetic treatment of lady as an object of love, a comparative study with Dante highlights the macro-textual implications of different conceptions of the amorous subject. The second part is devoted mainly to an analysis of the Vita nova, but ends with a return to the poetics of Guido Cavalcanti with a reading of the song Donna me prega and a focus on Cavalcantian influences in a late poems by Dante. The conflict of subjectivities, between an active and volitional subject and a passive subject, hides a conflict of temporality, between the teleology of the narrative and an absolute lyrical circularity. The third part mainly studies Petrarch's Canzoniere. In this work, two tendencies coexist: the search for narrative linearity and subject\u2019s unity, according to the model of augustinian conversion, and the tendencies towards the fragmentation of the subject. This third part corroborates the hypothesis that the textual form can be read as an objective correlative, a formal equivalent, of the psychological construction of the lyrical subject.","The interwar years in France witnessed a revival of sacred Art. After the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, the Church had to reorganize and renew its spiritual message and reposition its action in the context of a changing society. The creation of religious art workshops as well as the launching of the Parisian \u201cChantiers du Cardinal\u201d, initiated by cardinal Verdier, supported by a number of reviews such as L\u2019Art Sacr\u00e9, gave a new impulse to the production of religious art. The diocese of Bayonne took a full part in this initiative. It was keen to contribute in original and dynamic ways to this new direction and tried to include regional elements and in particular features reflecting Basque and Bearnais identities. The joint work done by bishops and priests involved in building churches, architects, glassmakers and mosaic artists, painters, sculptors and even goldsmiths, shows how well-established and even conventional designs were revisited to produce an art which hesitated between daring innovation and compromise. Indeed, the sacred art of the diocese of Bayonne was marked by a mixture of tradition and renewal, regionalism and modernity.","This thesis aims at defining the nature of the link between the use of digital writing in instant messaging and the quality of spelling performance. That is why it was necessary to understand what happens from a cognitive perspective when adolescents \u2013 who are exposed to the standards of spelling almost every day \u2013 produce standard and digital writing. We carried on with the research work that has been performed so far by dividing our analysis into two sections (the first that aims at deeply defining digital writing in instant messaging; the second at identifying the nature of the link that has been mentioned supra). First, we have defined (a) digital writing when it was used by adolescents, identified (b) the kind of knowledge which may be impacted and that allows producing modifications (which are the modified words in digital writing), and tried (c) to know whether the context of production has an influence on adolescent performance. Second, we tried to know (d) whether the spelling level is related to the production of modification, (e) whether using some modifications is more at risk than using others, and (f) whether being exposed to digital writing in instant messaging has consequences on the quality of spelling performance. For this thesis, we used different types of methodology by analyzing corpuses, comparing performances by taking the media into account (standard or digital) or the group (e.g., French speaking and English speaking). The first part of results showed that (a) digital writing in instant messaging is closer to the oral code than the written code, that (b) the kind of knowledge that may be impacted (related to the value of letters) corresponds to the one which allows producing both spelling and modifications, and that (c) the context of production (between French speaking and English speaking adolescents) has as much influence on performance than orthographic depth of a language. The second part of results showed that (d) the adolescents with a good spelling level produce more modifications than adolescents with a low spelling level, that (e) the modifications that can be confused with misspellings are more at risk than those that cannot, and that (f) being exposed to digital writing in instant messaging for adolescents whose spelling level is low and whose spelling knowledge is still being consolidated has negative consequences on spelling performance. To finish, the nature of the link differs according to the spelling level of participants (even if the context of production has an influence on performance unconditionally). On the one hand, it is proved to be negative for adolescents whose spelling level is low and whose spelling knowledge is still being consolidated. The phonetisation of writing, the production of modifications that can be confused with misspellings, and the associated risk when knowledge related to the value of letters is not yet consolidated have something to do with it. On the other hand, it is proved to be neutral for adolescents with a high spelling level.","The Medieval Jewish philosophers used esoteric writing strategies in order to deal with matters of critical importance. The opposition between the \u00ab religious theory \u00bb of the creation of the world and the \u00ab philosophical theory \u00bb of its eternity constitues one of the most typical example of such subjects. Since Leo Strauss\u2019 works, these \u00ab arts of writing \u00bb have been generally considered as means of hiding heterodox opinions, used by the philosophers in order to avoid political persecution. We try to show that this esotericism does not stem from mere political calculation, but from intrinsically philosophical considerations : the limitation of langage itself, that fails to express certain issues, such as the radical origin of all things. From this starting point, we discuss the views and writing strategies of diverse Jewish philosophers, active between the 10th and the 15th centuries, each of whom held a different theory on creation (Saadia Gaon, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Maimonides, Isaac Albalag, Gersonides and \u1e24asday Crescas). We argue that the doxographic perspective, aiming at identifying each author\u2019s \u00ab real view \u00bb, is not appropriate when dealing which such esoteric writings, which we propose to envisage as the manifestation of a specific philosophical style, emerging in the Medieval period from the confrontation between philosophy and \u00ab revelation \u00bb.","The liking for somewhere else and the desire for distant lands, very much in vogue at the end of the XVIIIth and during the XIXth century, marked considerably the literary works of period. The reading of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's poetic and romantic works proves the indisputable presence of exoticism as a decisive theme and as one of the main frameworks of the writings of this poet. The objective of this study will thus be to analyze the particular view point of the poet with regard to distance and its perception of elsewhere, on a thematic level as much as on the aesthetic and philosophic levels. The study of Gautier's poetic writing fully demonstrates how literary exoticism evolves in the social and political context of the time, but it also reveals the originality of Gautier\u2019s approach on the question of the exoticism, quite different from that of his contemporaries. The relevance of the East consists mainly in Gautier's contradictory image of the East and the West. The East is an anti-model in relation to the West. This difference defines Gautier\u2019s aesthetics. Exoticism seems, nevertheless, unable to free the poet from his \u2018mal du si\u00e8cle\u2019, the notion of elsewhere thus being put in doubt, increasing thus the status of Art and Beauty as absolute solutions for the writer","Under the Old Regime, physical suffering was an essential element of punishment. The detainees were kept in captivity for the purpose of reparation of their fault for the purpose of amendment. Since deprivation of liberty is characterized by cruelty and unhealthy conditions of detention, medicine in prisons has long been considered as \"an extra soul\" of the prison institution and relegated to the rank of \"deputy doctor\" by the entire medical field because of its submission to the administration.It is in this conception of punishment that the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which states that the law must establish only those penalties that are strictly necessary, is part of this concept. At the beginning of the 20th century, the prison administration still treats its prisoners. This led to real psychological and health disasters, as the doctor depended on prison and non-health institutions. Until the Liberation, the history of health and the health professions in prison is marked by a profound continuity that is expressed, first of all through a continuous opposition between the expression of philanthropy in reforms and the confrontation with an austere reality of health in a totalitarian prison. The autonomy of those in charge of health in prison is hardly guaranteed. Prisons are still exempt from the great sanitary and hygienic revolutions.The appearance of the AIDS virus and pathologies is changing mentalities. Between the 1970s and 1980s, a movement emerged from a civil society demanding respect for human rights, while scientific and political developments, as well as political and prison developments, gradually revealed the limits of this new organization: the affirmation of a chronically poor administration, whose care is certainly not its primary mission, relegates the whole system to the bottom of a poverty funnel, while the first epidemiological approaches point to an over-morbidity in this population in terms of age, particularly in terms of infectious, addictive and dental diseases.","Hairstyles and headdresses, as strong elements of communication, allow to address the cultural and identity affiliation of their wearers. This dissertation, through this new approach, aims to shed light on the place and role of hairstyles and headdresses in Aegean civilizations of the Bronze Age.Our study is mainly based on two complementary sources: direct sources (metal headbands) and indirect sources (iconography). Our approach led to propose a new morpho stylistic typology of hairstyle and head ornaments visible in iconography. The various representations have shown that certain hairstyles and headdresses are gendered, chrono cultural and social markers. A double visual examination (macroscopic and microscopic observation) of the metal headbands enabled us to reconstruct their cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. This analysis highlighted technical differences (manufacture and decoration) and use wear closely linked to chrono-cultural contexts. This dissertation also suggests that the headbands should be worn in combination with a cloth.Through the study of immaterial traces and the mobilization of various sources (iconographic, archaeological, textual and comparative), we tempted to perceive the tools and the gestures associated with the treatment of the hair, but also the materials which could have been used for making the head ornaments represented in iconography. Finally, reconstructions of the wearing of the headband have shown the multiple possibilities of how to wear this type of artefact.","Under a socialist impulse, the law of 4 March 2002, called \u00abKouchner law\u00bb, laid the foundations of health democracy, on the margins of the courts and central administrations. At the time, the ONIAM allowed, the hopes of reordering a power until then verticalized, in addition to let believe in the decongesting of asphyxiated courts. But quickly, the euphoria of 2002 and the dreams of horizontality evaporate. Because it is officially devoid of the name \u201cagency\u201d, ONIAM plays on the terrain of ambiguities. The thesis\u2019s bias is to show how the legal and political vagueness surrounding French agencies is politically useful. The history of ONIAM is symptomatic of the French administrative taxonomy and reveals a ruse of the State. At the same time as we are witnessing the organization of the justice system, the singular case of the ONIAM comes to thwart the limits of this type of organization, to the point of reconsidering the theoretical framework as it is commonly accepted. The instrumental track is privileged, as the ONIAM embodies a power apparatus giving politicians the means to accommodate and subtly free themselves from the organizational and structural constraints of the agency. The instrumentalization of the agency\u2019s structuring principles would be in favor of political interests: sometimes by replaying partisan struggles in the perspective of extending public policy networks in an extra-judicial zone, sometimes by considering neo-judicial strategies corporatists, sometimes protecting themselves from political risks associated with health risks. Through the case of ONIAM, the thesis takes up the delicate and disturbing question of who benefits from the agency process of the justice system?","This thesis studies current developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and asks the following research questions: (1) Why is a great enthusiasm invested in these technologies even though they are poorly understood; (2) What grants power to quantifications, and specifically to AI quantifications? After proposing a conceptualization of accounting, we argue that quantifications become powerful when they become accounting. We study whether AI becomes an accounting technology and to do so we study the ideals associated with it. We show that they are the result of an imaginary as conceptualized by Cornelius Castoriadis in The Imaginary Institution of Society (1975, \u00c9ditions du Seuil, Paris). This imaginary is carried out by the action of the people, which participates symmetrically in giving it a shape, it is at the same time the result of socio-historical evolutions. We first trace the socio-historical-technical evolutions of AI before looking at the current context through three distinct empirical materials that allow us to link local and global levels. We argue that an accounting regime emerges with AI, which we characterize and propose that it helps understand changes in the accounting practice. We further argue that it is the specificity of AI quantifications, which are the result of practices and an imaginary, that allows us to understand the enthusiasm invested in them. Finally, we propose that the use of AI requires efforts of distinction so that it does not diminish the autonomy of people.","This dissertation explores how intraorganizational networks and interorganizational collaboration, individually and jointly, shape firm innovation. Organizations rely on both external and internal collaboration to obtain and integrate knowledge in new products and processes. Internal collaboration networks among R&D scientists facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer whereas external collaboration via alliances and joint ventures provide an organization with access to new knowledge. This model is empirically tested in the North-American medical devices industry between 1990 and 2005. Contrary to the expectations, more cohesive and clustered intrafirm networks actually reduce knowledge transfer and diversity, which then reduces firm innovation. But well-connected intrafirm networks augment the effects of interorganizational collaboration on firm innovation. This dissertation contributes to the networks and innovation literature by examining the mechanisms that mediate the effects of network structure on firm innovation. It also explores the multilevel nature of networks by combining both intrafirm and interfirm relationships to explain firm innovation","Visual attention is one of the most important mechanisms deployed in the human visual system to reduce the amount of information that brain needs to process. In fact, an increasing amount of efforts have been dedicated in the studies of visual attention on natural images (2D stimuli). However, less attention was made for 3D scenes which corresponds to a more complex data as it including the geometry and the appearance attributes information. In this thesis, we present studies focusing on several aspects of the research of visual saliency. Our works is mainly divided into three parts including low level concept, mid level concept and higher level concept. The first part of this thesis addresses the low-level concept where we propose to predict where humans look when gazing 3D graphical objects by investigating the validity of the models and the hypothesis made in 2D imaging to 3D contents. This is very useful in certain scenarios such as interactive streaming or visualization of these contents in virtual or augmented reality applications. The second part corresponds to a mid-level concept where we introduce a perceptual measure for visual attention complexity which is pooled from the saliency information. Our proposed measure can be used to boost 3D-based quality aAssessment metrics and also for 3D content characterization . The third part explores a higher level concept related to viewpoint preference of 3D graphical objects where we show the relevance of the visual attention complexity feature. Along the thesis, we constructed several databases of colorful graphical 3D objects and we carried out a series of subjective experiments for different tasks, including crowdsourcing experiments as an alternative to in-lab experiments.","This thesis revisits the relationship between visual attentional processes and the perception of quality. We mainly focus on the perception of degradation in video sequences and their overall impact on our perception of quality. Rather than a global approach, we work in a very localized spatio-temporal scale, more adapted to the decision-process in video encoders. Two approaches linking visual attention and perceived quality are explored in the thesis. The first follows a classical approach, of the distortion weighting type. This is very useful in certain scenarios such as interactive streaming or visualization of omni-directional content. The second approach leads us to the introduction of the concept of visual disruption(DV), and explore its relation to perceived quality. We first propose techniques for studying the saccades related to DV from experimental oculometric data. Then, a computational model for the prediction of DV is proposed. A new objective measurement of quality is therefore born, which we call the \"Disruption Metric\" : that allows the evaluation of the local quality of videos. The results obtained, find their applications in many fields such as quality evaluation, compression, perpetually optimized transmission of visual content or foveated rendering \u002f transmission.","This thesis offers to examine theory of art and art criticism texts about painting in 17th and 18th c. France, via the angle of verisimilitude. Numerous thoughts upon the legitimacy of the criticism of those who do not practice painting have preceded the birth of art criticism, and the debate is still going on during the 18th c. However, the notion of verisimilitude, present in art theory discourses (by painters or not) about the creation of an art piece, manifests that the perception of the painting by someone looking at it is taken into account, this time from the point of view of reception: can \u201cone\u201d believe what the painting shows? We aim at proving the crucial role of verisimilitude in giving art critic legitimacy. If a spectator \u2013 who is not a painter \u2013 has no legitimacy to judge the quality of drawing or colour in an art piece, he can say whether the painting is credible or not.We compare and study the several acceptations of verisimilitude in theorists and critics\u2019 writings in order to highlight that the notion is considered as a rule of painting on both sides, and analyse its evolution in 18th c. discourses.","The thesis explores the role of the large public landowners (Army, University, Hellenic Public Real Estate Corporation, other large national-organizations or institutions) to the production of urban space in Greece. The object of research is thus to explore from the outset the mechanisms and procedures that create public spaces and communal facilities in Greece, and, in particular, to reveal the ways in which the management of various categories of public land has influenced and continue to influence the making of towns and cities. The city of Thessaloniki constitutes a privileged ground for this analysis. Due to its geographical situation and recent history, the city has hosted institutional bodies that were bestowed by large parcels of urban land, and made a significant and visible impact on urban fabric. The integration of the city into the Greek State in 1912 is a chronological starting point, since at that time the future economic and political role of the city was set within the new national context. The thesis examines the following topics: On the national level, the evolution of a framework for the production of urban space and communal facilities, the formation of policies on the public land management, and in this context the function of institutional owners through the study of concrete examples. On the local level, the role of two institutional landowners and the management of their land in the making of urban space of Thessaloniki: These are the University, spreading out under increasing demand, and the Army, gradually withdrawing under the pressure to cede underused military sites, already sought after by other urban functions.","This thesis aims to relate contemporary transformations of democratic legitimacy with the expansion of participatory instances in recent decades. It takes argentinean experiences as an illustration, developing field research in Moron, Rosario and Ciudad de Buenos Aires\u2019 municipalities, between 2007 and 2010. We begin with a definition of the \u201clegitimacy of proximity\u201d as a new kind of legitimacy according to the attributes politicians must show. It implicates a new type of identification between representatives and represented, denominated \u201canti-charismatic identification\u201d, with politicians needing to present themselves as \u201cordinary men\u201d. Legitimacy of proximity appears on political representation linkages, but it finds in participatory mechanisms its most institutionalized form. Indeed, we try to demonstrate how these mechanisms are nowadays the institutions of proximity. We build a classification of mechanisms according to each aspect of legitimacy of proximity that is crystallized, differentiating five types : mechanisms of participation-experience like participatory budgeting ; mechanisms of participation-presence like \u201cbanca abierta\u201d and \u201cconcejo en los barrios\u201d ; mechanisms of participation-denunciation like the anti-corruption bureau ; mechanisms of participation-immediacy like the commission of urban hygiene and forums of security ; and, finally, mechanisms of participation-recognition like the councils of elderly people or handicapped people and young participatory budgeting.","Critical theory remains incapable of evaluating the impact of digital transformation on the socio-political order. On the one hand, constructivist approaches of technology tend to reduce its effects to the ad-hoc interests of those who instrumentalize it, thus providing a piecemeal and tactical understanding of its political stakes. On the other hand, epistemological critiques of technology keep describing the many ruptures provoked by new digital practices, but say nothing about the structural, political dimension of these radical mutations. This dissertation proposes to bring these critiques into a unified, epistemic perspective, in order to articulate the impact of digital transformation on the implicit theoretical framework which underlies the legitimacy, and more fundamentally, the condition of possibility of liberal democracy. It combines critical theories of technology with a more classical approach of political theory, by insisting on the contingency of political regimes, which always rely and depend on certain social conditions (understood not only as social practices, but also as a embodying the symbolic, epistemic component of reality). The political stakes of digital transformation are thus approached through the lense of the social imaginary\u2014not so much to show the influence of technology on the representations that institute the common world, but rather to suggest that the issue is first and foremost poetic: theory must reclaim its creative power, and dare to imagine a radically transformed socio-political (and conceptual) horizon.","The impact of emotion on cognition has taken an important part in Neuroscience as well as in Human Science researches. Up until now, numerous studies focused on elaborating this subject with adults only. On the contrary, few studies have been conducted in children and even less in the more ecological approach of learning. This thesis aimed at studying the influence of emotions on the orthographic process in primary school students. This study relies on orthographic specificities and its diverse cognitive processes and it is grounded on the RAM model (Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988; Ellis & Moore, 1999) suggesting that emotions engage a part of the attentional resources at the expense of the achievement of the ongoing task. To that end, five experimental tasks were accomplished to test the effect of the induction of an emotional state (positive or negative) by means of music, on the orthographic performances in different writing tasks (free and controlled writing tasks, copying and an error spotting task). Generally, results indicate that a negative emotional state alters the orthographic performances of primary school students. In line with the hypothesis of attentional deprivation triggered by emotion, multiple variables contribute to this effect, such as the type and cognitive cost of the task, the item\u2019s type and the level of expertise of the subject. Accordingly, the negative emotion is associated with low performances especially when the task is costly cognitively and requires a high attention level. These results can be observed on the success rate of the task and the time of its execution.The fact that the effect of emotion varies according to the attentional cost of the task validates the hypothesis suggesting emotion as a supplementary cognitive charge. However, it could be interesting to investigate the nature of the mechanisms leading to this emotional deprivation. Moreover, and in opposite to what was predicted by the RAM model, the experiments of this study do not account for a positive or negative effect of the induction of a positive emotion on performances. This result is discussed in terms of methodological constraints for inducing and measuring an emotion.","Wilhelm von Humboldt famously said that language makes \u201cinfinite use of finite means\u201d. Concretely, humans are able to combine words following a fixed set of grammatical rules, yielding a limitless reservoir of meanings. This is what I mean by compositionality, and what this thesis has aimed to characterize. Using a combination of tools from linguistics, natural language processing and neuroimaging, I sought to describe how this impressive feat is implemented in the human brain. In the first part, I present a study that examines the rise of compositional representations. We isolate semantic processes by comparing normal sentences with ones made of meaningless pseudowords, aka Jabberwocky. Using joint magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography recordings, we show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the neural signals grows over time, and more so for normal sentences than Jabberwocky, portraying the progressive recruitment of neurons in the semantic representation. Furthermore, by means of multivariate decoding, we demonstrate that the dynamics of neural signals follow theoretically driven patterns, especially ramping and sentence-final signatures. In addition, we take advantage of the fine spatial resolution of intracranial recordings to quantify the participation of various brain regions in each of these steps and identify a chief role of the prefrontal cortex in compositional processes. Crucially, these signatures are present in state-of-the-art neural language models, but absent in untrained models, suggesting that learning language is associated with a predictable shaping of the neural vector space. Overall, we show that the neural representations of sentences grow with each additional meaning that can be added to the existing semantic manifold. The second study takes a finer experimental approach by focusing on the cortical representation of phrases composed of a small number of nouns and adjectives, in a working memory task with distinct sentence encoding, delay, and picture comparison stages. Using magnetoencephalography recordings and multivariate decoding, we collect brain responses to words in isolation and within increasingly longer phrases, and use these data to investigate the organization and temporal evolution of compositional representations. During the encoding phase, a cascade of activations follows each new word, and crucially, the representation of individual words is partially sustained until it can be coherently integrated into a phrase, at which point it fades away. Later, during the delay period, in which the subjects keep in mind the sentence to match it to a subsequent image, neural activity reflects the complexity of the sentence, as quantified by the number of different words it comprises. Finally, when the compositional representation has to be read-out, the speed of this mechanism is also modulated by complexity, as well as by the syntactic depth of the query: surface properties are detected faster than syntactically deeper ones. These findings suggest that the compositional word representations are compressed in working memory and require task-specific decompression to be accessed. Taken together, these findings shed new light on the nature of compositional representations in the human brain. Both studies point towards the idea that semantic representations are encoded in distributed vector spaces, perhaps similar to artificial neural language models and vector-symbolic architectures. We provide the first steps towards the characterization of these neural semantic spaces, their dimensionality and how they evolve over time.","This thesis is a multidisciplinary approach which characterizes the electric guitar in complementary perspectives to qualify it and give it the status of subject of study in a musicological framework for renewed methods. The first part is a presentation of the essential tools that make up the environment of the instrument and the musician. It deals with the electrification of the guitar, its hardware configuration, the relationship of the musician to the instrument and the influence of studio audio techniques in music production. The second part is an organological study of the most famous models of solidbody electric guitars (Fender Telecaster, Stratocaster and Gibson Les Paul) and some alternatives. This approach shows that the electric guitar remains in extremely varied forms today despite widespread archetypes that have become a benchmark worldwide. The third part is devoted to the speech of guitarists who gave their own definition of the electric guitar under unusual perceptual studies. Verbal data were collected and analyzed. The results presented relate to the representations of brands and models, and the study of the vocabulary of this community of musicians. All of this work is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between research teams in musicology, psychology\u002flinguistics and mechanics.","If we admit that one learns through experience, what do we do next? Confronted with the phenomenon of on-the-job learning, isn\u2019t there a real necessity to provide proper scientific validation? This thesis focuses on the nature and the construction process of experiential knowledge, based on the point of view of supervisors on insertion sites in the Ardennes region of France. The specificity of these research participant is that, the practice a trade for which they have never been trained. Thus, experiential knowledge is analysed as knowledge acquired while practicing a job. The conceptual framework includes concepts drawn from the vast area of social constructivism to define experience either from that of the subjectivist point of view or from a social construction and context approach. Concepts relating to the access to experiential knowledge are also brought into consideration. Two methods of data collection have been used: semi-structured interviews and the heuristic group. The data analysis is based on the perspective of research participants. The data collected were examined according to the strategy of continuous thematic analysis. The action schema inspired by Heinz (2000) served as a grid for data interpretation. The results do indeed indicate that supervisors on insertion site acquire professional knowledge while practicing their trade. Data analysis reveals that the professional knowledge of supervisors on insertion sites is intimately linked to the specific level of contextualisation and that this knowledge is built through four steps of action: strategic action, progressive action, risk-taking action and wait-and-see form of action. In our conclusion, it appears that the principal skill of an experienced supervisor is self-adaptation competence.","This study deeply renews our understanding of the funerary practices of the first farmers living in Italy and in southern France at the dawn of Neolithic. The hypothesis of their uniformity, which has been not truly questioned so far, is now invalidated. On the contrary, the very essence of the funerary ideology, that was spread and perpetuated by these societies during more than one millennium, is the diversity of the funerary practices. Indeed, this variability including variousforms of corpse deposits (primary, secondary, individual, plural) nevertheless displays codesvarying from a culture to another, a group to another, a site to another and from an individual toanother, creating a diverse but coherent system. This study has also highlighted symbolic practices exploiting human remains, and revealed their procedures. Relying on a reasoned visionof the neolithisation process and on the nature of the Impresso-cardial complex, this approach also reaches the role occupied by the funerary system within the multifaceted complementarity between sites as well as the innovation degree of burial gestures, whose Mesolithic origin appears limited. Following an archaeothanatological approach and mobilizing a broad panel of after-death archaeological testimonies on a wide corpus (45 sites, 87 funerary units, 128 individuals) has therefore not only allowed accessing the funerary system of the considered societies, but on the top of that, studying and describing the behaviours they adopted in regard of the corpse and towards Death.","The dissertation focuses on the regime of subjectivity of the actors of contestation in Turkey, in order to question the nature of the contemporary movements and the particularities of left-wing commitment. The fieldwork, that begins with the mobilizations following the assassination of Hrant Dink in 2007, ends at the first commemoration of the Gezi movement in 2014. Qualitative data collected through interviews and observation from different generations of militants and activists are analyzed through the lens of subjectivization and desubjectivization. What are the effects of emotions, collective memory and future horizons on agency ?\tThe first part of the dissertation sheds light on the diversity of modalities of action such as moral shock mobilizations, initiatives of intellectuals, electoral strategies, an anti-war music festival from the anti-globalization movement. The mobilizations that bring together the revolutionary generations and the younger activists are part of the global logic of collective action. The claims of democracy are expressed both by the transition from the revolutionary horizon to a paradigm of human rights, and by prefigurative practices.\tThe second part examines dialectics between memory and utopia in the political imaginary of actors. The analysis of the various cultural and political manifestations of the collective memory of a fragmented left shows both permanence and mutations in values, symbols, habitus and repertoire of action. While the regime of subjectivity marked by defeat is transformed with self-representations as victims of violence, the younger generations participate to the elaboration of a communicative memory. The struggle for democracy reveals itself as a memory struggle to build shareable narratives at the level of social memory.\tCombined with a reflection on the function of utopia for agency, memory is part of the analytical tools deployed to study the Gezi movement of June 2013. The occupation of Gezi Park displays several concomitant characteristics of contemporary movements, with its emotional configuration, the intergenerational dynamics, the resymbolisation of the space, and the transgression of the symbolic boundaries of alterity. The occupation of Gezi Park is analyzed as the public performance of utopia. The creation of such spaces of experience and subjectivization does not presage the translation into politics of movements. The marginality and the minority condition of the left can be both a resource and a limit. The dissertation proposes a sociology of marginality in a conservative and authoritarian context, and thus the demonstration of the creativity of action and its limits. \tIn sum, contemporary movements in Turkey have both components of social movement, ethical movement and experience movement. They challenge the historical frameworks of alterity and nationalism by incarnating democratic practices and they create a symbolic and axiological world that is alternative to the dominant cultural orientations.","Heidegger changes the phenomenological motto: \u201cBack to the things themselves!\u201d in an effort to think the Singularity: he connects the Principe of Identity to the Principe of Individuation. He chooses his vocabulary in reference to Identity: he binds together the words of identity, authenticity, with the concept of the Same, for his whole life, since his former study about medieval \u201chaecceitas\u201d to his analytical project of Dasein\u2019s \u201cipseitas\u201d, and since his great H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s commentary to his researches about \u201c\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u201d in the early Greek philosophy. Identity is the Self\u2019s Own and needs 1\u00b0) to be connected to Equality of beings in regard to the Being itself \u2013 which is the ontological Difference \u2013 2\u00b0) and, at the same time, involved into the adventure of Being, in a rhythm of appropriation and desappropriation. The unity of Man or People in History, and analogically the Unity of the Being, shows the inner alternative between Familiarity and Strangeness. The author of this book plans to explain how Heidegger loved this idea of Identity, and always defended it against the lost of its singularity in conceptions and genders. Heidegger\u2019s way through thought and poetry shows the same weariness: to understand \u201cThe Same\u201d as the Self and the Self as the Same, not only in men\u2019s relationships, but in ontology too. At last, \u201cDas Selbe\u201d to Heidegger seems to be the most important Name in the quest of Wisdom, leading the thinking in psychoanalyse like in philosophy.","The purpose of this dissertation is to study Italian translations of French chivalric narrative and French translations of Italian chivalric narrative from the late 15th century to 1560. The work lays at the intersection of two fields of study: medieval texts still read during the Renaissance and literary vernacular exchanges between France and Italy. For this purpose, I have studied some almost unknown French and Italian texts and compared each of them to the original in the other language. Regarding France, I have examined the translations of Guerrin Meschino, Morgante il Gigante, Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso. As far as Italy is concerned, I have analyzed the translation of Guiron le Courtois preserved in a manuscript from Florence (first quart of 16th century.) The same chivalric romance of Guiron was later adapted in Italian verses by the court poet Luigi Alamanni, at the request of the French monarch (1547). Finally, I have studied some Italian translations from French (Meliadus, Lancelot and Perceforest) as part of a chivalric editorial collection published in Venice in the mid-16th century.In addition to the analysis of the translations, I have broadly investigated the chivalric romance with special regard to its late editorial evolution and its reception, especially, the public reception, the invention of a \u201cmodern\u201d romance in the forties, the blurred boundaries of the chivalric romance genre and the perception of these texts in the 16th century imaginary.","This thesis evaluates four French urban and regional policies. It also covers three major issues in urban economics: the impact of transportation on the spatial distribution of employment and population, the elasticity of housing supply and urban segregation. First, the thesis focuses on the Regional Express Rail system. The improvement of public transport in the Paris region causes employment to grow in suburban municipalities. However, there is not effect on overall population growth but a possible gentrification effect nearby RER stations. Secondly, this thesis studies the role of high-speed rail in the spatial organization of multi-plant businesses. It shows that the reduction in travel time to their headquarters subsidiaries lead the affiliate to specialize in production activities, to the expense of management tasks. Then, this work assesses the impact of the French Urban Enterprise Zones. The first generation of this program have a massive impact on firm location and employment. However, it only slightly benefited to the local residents, highlighting a lack of targeting. The last chapter evaluates the effect of housing allowance on the level of rents and the supply of rental housing. It confirms that housing subsidies cause private rents to increase. The elasticity of housing supply remains low in the long term, since the upward effect does not vanish and the quantity and the quality of rental housing do not adjust.","Until now, the main interest of historians towards the work of the etcher of architecture Jean Marot (about 1619-1679), who represented many buildings of the Grand Si\u00e8cle (the \u201cgreat century\u201d, as one calls the 17th century in France), was based on their value as sources for the history of the building in question. Our thesis parts from another point of view and asks about the method, the evolution, the form, the objectives and the reception of these images as part of the tradition of the representation of real architecture which becomes important during the Renaissance in Italy and reaches a climax with the Cabinet du Roi of Louis XIV. One of Jean Marot\u2019s major works is the anthologie called the \u201cGrand Marot\u201d (small folio, probably 1686), which renews with the tradition of collections of prints showing the most important buildings of the kingdom, founded by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, author of the Plus excellents b\u00e2timents de France (Paris, 1576\u002f1579). As the latter, Marot consecrated a group of prints (etched with some engraved details) to the Louvre and the Tuileries in Paris, two initially separated palaces related according to the \u00ab grand dessein des rois \u00bb, initiated by Henri IV as a major symbol of power of the king. The Louvre-etchings are appropriate for the examination of a concrete example and at the same time offer the possibility to learn more about of the evolution of the \u201cGrand Marot\u201d. Interpreting the drawings of architects, Marot often disposes only of a fragmentary documentation, which he combines and completes, always attempting to present his own inventions concerning architecture and decoration. Related to various objectives of self-promotion, dedication and representation of power, the work of Jean Marot gives evidence of a crucial moment, when the state undertook a growing control and organization of artistic production","The television channels broadcasting in a Celtic language (TG4, Ireland), S4C (Wales), BBC ALBA (Scotland), FRANCE 3 Bretagne\u2019s programmes in Breton and BREZHOWEB (France\u002fBretagne) rest on languages whose linguistic demographics is worrying. These languages are supported by laws and strategies and by the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages. In a bilingual environment, they depend on favourable public opinions and on language education. Their expression and promotion is boosted by the Celtic television channels. Faced with a very strong competition in a hyper-fragmented mediascape, they are centers of resistance against globalization, located .in the \u201cspace of places\u201d (Manuel Castells), broadcasting for \u201cimagined\u201d language communities (Benedict Anderson). Their dependence on financial flows (Arjun Appadurai) creates a permanent tension between economy and media. The financial and economic crisis has triggered a reduction or a stagnation of these channels\u2019 budgets, resulting in social and economic difficulties for them and their independent producers. Most of the channels are now deterritorializing some of their programmes through internet. They increase their audience rates among their diasporas and the public at large by resorting to optional subtitles andadapting international formats such as soap operas or sitcoms. Part and parcel of convergence, these channels are available on numerous digital platforms. Therefore, their future will depend on a post-Brexit agreement, on the  implementation of the European Digital Single Market, but above all on the younger generation\u2019s approach towards learning Celtic languages and their use on the many audio-visual digital platforms","From the mid-10th century, together with the emergency and the development of a community conscientiousness, the medieval Christian Church sets up a consecrated cemetery forbidden to the \"bad Dead\". At the same time, the landscape and the social practices change due to a better defined guidance of the Faithful on liturgical, sacramental and juridical aspects. From the 11th century and more particularly by the 12th and 13th centuries, the decretalists, liturgists and Canonists list out a number of \"bad Christians' \" groups deprived of sepultura ecclesiastica, who were previously regarded as \"outsiders\" by the historians of written sources and the archaeologists. Despite of the ecclesiastical justice being uncompromising regarding the future of murderers, arsonists, jousters, and more generally, those who have been excommunicated, their reintegration within the Church is pondered.This study, promoting a multidisciplinary approach (written and archaeological sources), aims at understanding these funeral bans, as well as assessing in a new light the management of burial areas and their edges. It not only tends to shed light on the future of the bodies deprived of sepultura ecclesiastica, but it also raises the question on assuming the care of the \"bad Dead\" by the civil and lay\u002fsecular authorities. As such, it leads to see the execution areas (patibulary forks, gallows, etc.) as a full-fledged type of gathering the \"bad Dead\"","At the time of recycling and sorting , waste sorting , tools implementation , are invested by many actors in search of items to collect . This research, requested by a local authority whereas optimized waste management involves consideration of human factors, is in the field of social demand. The anthropological exploration of the universe of waste can complete the technical and scientific older analyzes . This work reflects the need to understand the process by ethnopragmatique discourse practices established for disposal and those that are spontaneously grafted informal practices . Addressing issues of legitimacy and ontological that prevailed in the competition practice dedicated to the same goal , that of giving a second life to waste , this research is based on a careful examination of the ordinary and dumped on a study of written or spoken language stakeholders.

It proposes a formal definition abyss frames and thought circumscribed by the initial field survey. It extends the knowledge on individual behavior , games players in connection with the waste. It refines the understanding of public and private organizations, their strategies, decision-making, the ability to change in waste policy.","In archaic and classical Greek literature, exile is shown to evolve within determining political contexts. From the VIIth to the IVth century B.C., through tyrannical and oligarchical regimes, but also during a period of democracy, it is both a punitive and preventive measure which is used to maintain an authority in power, tending to evolve towards a moderation of expulsions, notably through ostracism, while being more and more regulated by legislation. Exile may also be a deliberate move to flee away from life's woes, escape from a trial or even get away from a corrupt city. Beyond this political anchoring, the representations of exile and of exiled people take part in a rich imagined world which is exploited in all the literary genres at that time. These representations give life to reflection on history and the status of democracy, as well as on the metaphoric dimension of exile. Furthermore, the woes of exile, the grievance or the pollution which are associated with it go along with less expected representations, such as one of an active and vindictive society of exiled people or even one of archetypes of the good or the bad exiled person. Exile often comes to an end when one integrates a host haven or when one is called back to one's country of origin, but may as well be for the rest of one's life and sometimes continue after death. Eventually, the abundance of these representations, as well as the vocabulary associated with it, makes exile become an image suitable for the illustration of the leading political and philosophical concepts in Greek thought.","Abstract. This thesis aims at analysing venture capital contribution to the financing and performance of innovative companies via a theoretical contribution and an empirical analysis of the french venture capital industry. In the first chapter, we investigate whether venture capitalists add value to the going public process by improving the survival profile of french initial public offerings. To this end, we propose a hand-collected data set based on french companies that went public at the ``Nouveau March\u00e9\" between 1996 and 2002. The estimates show that venture capital backed companies have a lower survival rate than non venture capital backed companies. In order to explain the first results we obtain, we explore two ways of research both empirical and theoretical. In the second chapter, our additional empirical analyses show first that venture capitalists did not have a positive role on the going public process of french companies and, second, that the distinction between different types of venture capitalists can not explain the poor performance of venture capital backed companies. In the third chapter, we propose a model for syndication in the case of expertise and we compare our results with the ones obtained by Huang and Xu (2003) for financial syndication. We show that the nature of syndication has a direct impact on the decision of venture capital firms to refinance innovative projects and on their capacity to add value to the projects. We also show that the relative efficiency of financial structures depends strongly on the degree of innovation embodied in the project being financed.","This thesis analyses the political socialization of 92.6% of the Polish Members of the European Parliament during their first mandate from 2004 to 2009. Its aim is to understand in full this process in this institution which is by definition supranational and pro-European  and therefore to specify concretely which political actors (first part) comply with what, why, where, how long, how, thanks to whom or what (second part) and to what extent (third part). The study shows that political socialization in the first five years is not a very powerful process as it causes only the adjustment to everyday formal and informal specificities and, possibly, a more or less weak deepening of initial attitudes and behavior (in a pro or anti-European sense, according to the orientation). In other words, the process turns newcomers into experts without making them natives.  It either occurs only in part, in which case it would be preferable to characterize what actually happens simply as political integration and not as political socialization, or it takes more than five years, starting with the acquisition of Euro-parliamentary specificities, as this stage sometimes already takes the whole mandate.","Beginning with a historical and sociological study of six Mormonisms, this research analyzes the phenomenon of Mormon fissiparousness within its primarily Protestant and American context. The study explores: 1- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the majority Mormonism headquartered in Salt Lake City (Utah); 2- The Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; 3- The Mormonism of the Church of Christ (Temple Lot); 4- The Mormonism of the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite); 5- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite); 6- and finally, the Mormonism of the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite). These six Mormonisms were born out of the succession crisis which splintered the church at the death of Joseph Smith (1805-1844), founder of \u201cearly Mormonism. \u201d The historical research, fostered by the consultation of archives and other historical studies, presents the Mormonisms\u2019 ideological and structural developments. If Joseph Smith\u2019s first Mormonism was the indisputable result of 19th century American Protestant fissiparousness, it radically differed from evangelical Protestant orthodoxy until 1844. The six Mormonisms that developed after Joseph Smith\u2019s death then positioned themselves in different ways within the legacy they had inherited. The Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church gradually moved towards evangelical Protestantism, while the Community of Christ experienced radical, liberal Protestantization, and is today a progressive Protestantism with Mormonism as an option. The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) and the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) see Joseph Smith as a fallen prophet, while the Strangite and Cutlerite Mormonisms endeavor to preserve his legacy. While some Mormonisms attempted to expand beyond their American promised land origins after the Second World War, their ideological development remained dependent upon the American context. The sociological study is based on a questionnaire distributed to one congregation in each of the six Mormonisms, as well as observations made during several research trips between 2009 and 2013. The responses collected from the members are compared with the teachings found in the institutions\u2019 official manuals, field observations, and sociological studies to give them perspective. By questioning several aspects of Mormon b\u00c9liefs, practices, ethical expression, and political views, the study intended to highlight the degree to which the legacy and heritage of Protestantism and first Mormonism has been retained differently by these diverse Mormon denominations. Even though this legacy and heritage differ among the different Mormonisms, they have all retained a deep-rooted Americain identity. Although they sometimes appear to be \u201cglobalized,\u201d their ideological stances are ascribed to American societal debates.","Along with the globally rapid development of e-commerce, multichannel retail including both brick-and-mortar and online stores is in 2016 the standard for the sellers. However, such justified strategy not always guarantee retailers\u2019 success in commercial campaigns. Most of the time the difficulties arised from the lack of efficient coordination between the online store and its offline counterpart based upon their respective attributes. On the basis of the percieved congruence concept, this dissertation investigates subjects\u2019 evaluation on store attributes between the different channels of the Chinese multichannel retail market. Through the Depth Interview (Study 1), it was found that Chinese multichannel consumers prefer the multichannel shopping behavior. They like the between-channel congruence but also expect to enjoy the incongruent situation which indicates their propensity to compare the between-channel prices and assortment. The two quantitative studies identified the perceived congruence as a determinant to the subjects\u2019 evaluation towards the retailer. More precisely, the more congruence subjects perceive from the cross-channel price policy, the more price fairness subjects judge, turns in more favorable attitude toward the retailer (Study 2). In contrast, when the subjects perceive more schema incongruity, from the cross-channel assortment, they evaluate more variety (Study 3). But this consequence only occurs when the cognitive process is not constrained. In addition, both price fairness perception and variety perception are identified to mediate the effect of congruence perception on subjects\u2019 attitude toward retailers. Besides, subjects\u2019 experimental involvement, does not statistically support the moderation effect interacting with congruence perception on subjects\u2019 evaluation regarding channel store attributes, but the marginal effect in visualization indicates that researchers must, in future study, keep investigating the relevant influences between involvement and congruence perception.","As a prominent indicator of the French school system's structural problems, France\u2019s public authorities' willingness to take action in order to reduce inequalities in schools and to include all school-going groups finds itself up against school management policies and concrete organizational difficulties. This situation raises the issues of what training and practices teachers have when they are confronted with students' heterogeneity and the multiple contexts in which they practice their profession. This research paper aims to contribute to the study of primary school teachers, especially those in charge of specialized help for students in great difficulty, by shedding light on the social influences involved in professional trajectories and the logic behind training in lifelong learning. It is based on the lessons learned from an observation survey (direct, participatory and peripheral), a follow-up of two groups of teachers in training who were the subjects of a case study and nearly two hundred interviews. Its methodology is original for sociology because it integrates a collection of twenty-five professional real-life stories of specialized teachers. Its data was cross-referenced on content analysis scales using studies and statistics, training programs, reports and official texts. In order to identify its specificity, it seeks to characterize the problems encountered by teachers who will reposition themselves according to their students\u2019 needs (pedagogical, educational, social support). Thus a certain logic of action and training emerges that will exert an influence on the biographical trajectory of the individuals involved.","Energy poverty is at the confluence of housing, welfare and the environment; it is a question of public interest that has been on the political agenda in France for several years. If, at the outset of this research, the term 'energy poverty' had already permeated public policies, applied research and associations, very little was known about the concrete day to day situations this term refers to. Thus, the aim of this thesis has been to redefine the notion of energy poverty through the experience of the people affected by it and, thence, to analyse the mechanisms of state intervention in this field. The thesis is divided into three sections. The first studies the question's emergence into the public spheres in France and the United Kingdom, in today's context; it is based upon the study of documents and interviews with local actors. The second section proposes an ethnographic survey and aims to understand, from the families' point of view, what 'inhabiting' means in an energy poverty situation and, beyond this, the significance of 'being inhabited' by energy poverty. Finally a third section, also based on ethnographic study, deals with the relationships between the interviewees, utility companies, co-owner associations and landlords. It also deals with their relations with the State as beneficiaries of various public programmes destined to combat energy poverty. This section thus aims to establish an anthropology of the relations that those in extreme poverty develop with the State, relations that are described and analysed 'bottom up'.","Solidarity is a phenomenon that pushes people to help each other. We have defined it as \"a homogeneous group of individuals who come together to face an adversity\". After a study on pre-war natural disasters (earthquakes in southern Italy in december 1908 and in southern France in june 1909), we noted points of convergence between the solidarity needs expressed there and those that can be found during the First World War: high mortality, search for the missing, many wounded, presence of people in need of refuge, and finally the intervention of the French Red Cross. This observation is all the more important as it was on these bases that solidarity was organized during the Great War. The First World War began with a disaster, to which France, against all expectations at the time, was not ready. The first few months see all the elements mentioned above appear. This was not planned, and requires the intervention of the people \u00ab at the rear \u00bb to get out of this situation. At the beginning of 1915, a war solidarity society gradually established itself. The State progressively, regulated the phenomenon, and this leads, because of charity scams, to a series of laws covering the whole of society. As we went along, we detailed the main solidarity phenomena that are specific to each year, and demonstrated a real increase in the phenomenon throughout the conflict, of which the massive involvement of the American Red Cross is one of the highlights.","The aim of this work is the study of the constructed and represented spaces of video games. By testing the hypothesis of a form of \u201clanguage\u201d of level design, we shed light on the structural aspect of video game space, identifiable from one game to another within a \u201cshared grammar\u201d, but also its communicative value, as an instance of mediation between the game and the player. From a precise and detailed analysis of the way space is constructed and evolves in the series The Legend of Zelda (1986-2017), we formalize, classify and prioritize the different structures that make the repertoire of video game spatiality; then we highlight the mediation strategies implemented by games to facilitate the decoding of navigational information. We end up painting a diachronic portrait of the way this language is transformed, in particular concerning the question of navigation control, by mobilizing the notion-tool of \u201ccritical path\u201d and its implications in a formal and communicative history of video games.","The maternal mortality ratio in West Africa is the highest in the world and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality. The general objective of this work was to provide knowledge to improve the management of PPH in hospitals in West Africa. Firstly, we have highlighted that maternal risk factors for morbidity and mortality related to the PPH found in high-resource countries were generalizable to the context of West Africa. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the qualification of the doctor in charge of the maternity unit (general practitioner versus obstetrician) has a decisive impact on the maternal issue in this context. Then, we showed that injection of oxytocin within ten minutes after the diagnosis of PPH was a key factor for improving maternal health in Benin and Mali. Rapid diagnosis of PPH and better monitoring of the immediate postpartum period were also important. Finally, we set up a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which aims to test the effectiveness of uterine tamponade with condom catheter in the postpartum hemorrhage management in this region. The results showed that f a RCT was feasible and provided additional knowledge to optimize the research protocol. Thus, we have identified a number of factors on which action should be taken to improve the quality of PPH management.","Characterizing tongue gesture and its control in the production of [+palatal] consonants is still a matter of debate in phonetics and phonology. In this dissertation, we investigated the linguo-palatal gesture by focusing on its variability in the production of different consonant types and by suggesting that as a primary or secondary gesture, it could account for the notion of articulatory complexity and reflects some aspects of speech motor control. In addition to consonant type, three other variation factors were considered in this research: speaker, stress position and syllabic structure. Russian was chosen for the exceptional performance of the [\u00b1palatal] contrast in this language. In a multi-technique experimental approach, 3 complementary laboratory and field studies were carried out. The first one consisted in acquiring electromagnetic articulography data in order to measure the position and timing of 4 tongue regions. The 2nd consisted in collecting data from monolingual native speakers in Russia, using ultrasound imaging, in order to better understand linguo-palatal gesture variability related to diatopic and individual speaker variation. The third study is an analysis of a corpus of MRI images of vocal tract made up of a speaker\u2019s productions who participated in the other two studies. The experimental part is completed by a study on Russian phonotactics based on first-hand data which allowed us to update distributional trends of [+palatal] consonants. The findings confirm that palatalized consonants are more marked than non-palatalized ones and suggest marking degrees depending on the consonant place of articulation and the position within the syllable. The experimental results allowed us (1) to define the linguo-palatal gesture involved in the production of the palatalized vs non-palatalized contrast independently of the variability factors and (2) to discuss differences between labials, coronals and velars. We observed that palatalized coronals in stressed or unstressed syllable onsets are produced from a superposition of two successive primary and secondary constrictions. While no effect of stress or within syllable position on tongue shape contours was found, a more global movement of the tongue was observed in unstressed syllables and codas, whereas a sequential activation of the different tongue regions was observed in onset positions and in stressed syllables. This result suggests different motor control processes depending on stress and within syllable position. Still concerning the variation related to the distribution of palatalized consonants, tongue gesture properties seem to some extent specific to a given language. No effect of diatopic or language contact on tongue articulation were found contrary to findings of previous studies. Since it involves \"vowel muscles\", our results show that palatalization gesture blocks the coarticulation with adjacent vowels. Coarticulatory resistance could explain the apparent stability of the Russian consonant system despite its articulatory complexity and markedness. Our findings allow us to propose a unified natural class definition for [+palatal] consonants and to test it in the frameworks of (1) Articulatory Phonology to propose a formal gestural coordination modeling; (2) Element Theory to suggest a modeling of the Russian phonological system that unifies the palatalized, palatal-alveolar segments and the palatal glide through the primitive |I| for palatal resonance that can be supplementary to another resonance.","Sources of inspiration have a central role in the creative design activity. Our thesis work aims to study the cognitive processes of evocation of these sources of inspiration, but also ways to increase creativity with external supports providers sources of inspiration or also by training in reasoning by analogy with sources of inspiration. Our general hypothesis is that the expertise in creative design is the ability to make analog associations between the characteristics of the object to be designed (target) and those items that we can be inspired (sources); target and source may be close or distant domains. It follows that more great ability to evoke internal sources of inspiration, to use external sources of inspiration provided by a support system, or to learn how to take advantage of the reasoning by analogy are skills that depend on the level of expertise in creative design. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a series of three experimental studies with the participation of professional designers and product students in Product Design. The thesis work were able to highlight the conditions that promote the emergence of creative ideas from designers, this via experimental results. On this basis and according to the cognitive psychology ergonomic approach, the identification of cognitive processes used in creative activity helped to participate at the evaluation of a computational system for the activities of expert designers and the development of tools for stimulating creativity of novice designers.","Since the consumption of digital media exploded in the last decade, making aesthetic pictures quickly - with or without artistic expertise - is more than ever a research topic. Different axis of investigations remain possible: high resolution, high dynamic range or wide color gamut. Additionally to these objective image properties, more perceptual and artistic insights could be of benefit to any user manipulating pictures. In such context, this thesis deals with the topic of Color Harmony. The literature related to this topic is limited, but involves many different scientific areas: color science, image processing and psychology and so on. The validity of collected data is questionable due to their limitation to two- or three-colors patches. The models fitted from these data remain non-exploitable on natural pictures. Other models depicting rules or areas on color wheel lack scientific guidelines for their utilization. Nonetheless, some algorithms employing color harmony theory and models as a core concept showed up in the literature, but suffered from being quantitatively tested and validated. In this thesis, two views are put in perspective in order to respond to the previous statements: an experimental and a computational approaches. The conducted experiment allowed observing some effects with an eye-tracking protocol, never applied before with a task on color harmony assessment. From the collected data of our experimental work, we designed a method to generate a ground truth, which would serve to the validation of the two proposed computational methods. First, we improved an existing architecture for automatic color harmonization and demonstrated exhaustively the benefit of our approach. As a second computational contribution, a novel quality metric is introduced that integrates the concepts of visual masking and color harmony. Thus, we may predict which areas would be perceived harmonious regarding its neighborhood and then the potential masking effects. As a last contribution, two editing tools made accessible the color harmony theory through a hidden formulation of it and a user-friendly and intuitive interface.","Urban Cameroonians express a sense of passing through a time of \u201cmoral crisis\u201d concerning the paths and foundations of social success. A sets of representations and imaginaries link intimately the question of success to the denunciation of moral depravity. Critique of \u201cmisguided\u201d forms of success implies a denunciation of corruption, nepotism, scams, homosexuality and other forms of sexuality deemed to be scandalous. Criticism is also extended to \u201ccults\u201d and \u201coccult circles\u201d, \u201cmysticism\u201d, and \u201critual crime\u201d, as well as other practices connected to the imaginary of witchcraft and the occult.This thesis explores issues related to these critiques. By observing the practices of different urban social groups, an emic sense of the specific conceptions, figures, and paths of success in Yaound\u00e9 show that there are several constellations of norms, values, and feelings that impact how social success is judged, perceived, and legitimated.  An opposition principle emerges between, on one side, a moral economy of a facility based on the speed and disconnection of productive work, and on the other side, a moral economy of merit that is articulated around the recognition of the value of hard work, talent and competence.A number of moral stakes are structured around this opposition and are seen in the denunciation discourse of social actors. Through their critique, these actors construct, in different contexts, the \u201cscourges\u201d, social problems, and political \u201ccauses\u201d related to ways of becoming rich and succeeding. This is becoming increasingly visible and spectacular in recent years with major \u201caffaires\u201d agitating the public and political space of Cameroon.","We propose a contribution to the understanding of the international-multicultural tension operating in a team based on 4 exploratory cases of ERP-type IS projects and an extended literature. We answer the following research questions which sums up the essential questions of the Project Director who is left alone in situation with his own capacity facing both the importance of the human factor for the project success and the impracticality of the cultural models proposed by researchers for the management of international teams bringing together numerous people from various professions, nationalities and companies:1. How can we operationalize the human aspects of the CSF proposed by the literature for the management of international and multicultural project teams?2. To what extent changing the layer-view of cultural influence sources in models, for an approach in constellation of interactive and dynamic sources allows a better understanding of the international-multicultural tension in a team?3. To what extent and how do the concepts of community- and complementary cooperation identified in functional structure projects (Dameron) get applied to heavyweight projects?We highlight the complex entanglement of a wide range of factors that can either favour the existence of an effective and sustainable collaboration within a team having culture as milieu and project as attitude, or hinder it more than in a standard operational team (such as those studied by Barnard, 1938), particularly because of the conflict seeds brought in by the acculturation process inherent to bringing together so many different cultures (Bastide, 1968).","Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) still represents the leading cause of maternai morbidity and mortality in France. The PPH worsening to severe PPH can be explained by different factors: factors related to women, pregnancy and childbirth and \u002f or factors related to PPH management. The quality of this management cannot be evaluated independently of either the environment in which it is given or the characteristics of caregivers who provide them. Observational studies have partially assessed the potential determinants of the quality of care for PPH management. The objective of this PhD thesis was to develop and validate a methodology to study discrepancies with good practices and to assess determinants related to the organization of care and \u002f or caregivers. At first, we developed and validated dynamic case-vignettes with several steps, as tool assessing quality of PPH management. Then we used these case-vignettes to study variations in PPH management among 450 French midwives. Adherence to guidelines was low for pharmacological management. Finally, we investigated staff and institutional factors associated with substandard care. We showed both staff \u2014 i. E. Age, experience, and level of risk taking - and institutional factors \u00acmortality and morbidity reviews \u2014 may be associated with substandard eare in midwives' PPH management. Our method proves to be a relevant way to complete the observational studies on the subject.","The arrival of the photographic apparatus in nineteenth century Latin America must be considered as a technopolitical issue, and not only as the advent of a new form of representation that adds up to the old types of images already present in the New Continent. On the contrary, we consider that the apparatus\u2019 inherent mode of functioning, as a maker of technical images, modified the way of perceiving and considering the event. \tIn order to give an account of this \u201cchange in the means of perception\u201d as Walter Benjamin stated, we will first of all tackle the issue of the apparatus itself. We will try to understand the mo-de of functioning inherent to the photographic apparatus, its means of emergence, and the theoreti-cal context from which it buds, this is, the discussions around automatism in the frame of techni-que, but also in the frame of physiology theories that tried to render account of psychic automa-tism. Once this issue is set, we will address the question of the photographic apparatus\u2019 situation in the Latin American context. Thus, we will consider the apparatus as the  starting point, in order to reflect later upon the consequences of its insertion into a context that is completely foreign to its means of emergence.\tWe will thus approach the photographic images produced in nineteenth century Latin Ame-rica from the standpoint of the apparatus, since this is the one that made the various photographic uses and practices possible. It is its functioning mode which will have transformed perception, establishing, at the same time, a new temporality: the one of reproducibility.","Given the action of the FATF and its crucial role in raising awareness of AML \u002f CFT countries, it is now imperative to attribute to this working group the International legal personality thus establishing it in a true international organization. Such a question is already beginning to be solved progressively, more intensely, especially during the year 2019 when. Firstly, the United Nations Security Council has by 28 March 2019, adopted resolution 2642 (2019), which clearly demonstrates the role of the FATF in repetitive reference, and obliges States to comply with its recommendations. This only further testifies to the major and important role of the FATF in addressing the threats facing the financial system against terrorists and criminals and reinforces its role at the international level. On the other hand, the FATF has, since its thirtieth anniversary, celebrated on April 12, 2019, an unlimited mandate; decision taken by the Ministers of the member countries of the group. Such an initiative also enhances its effectiveness, enabling it to become the undisputed leader in international AML \u002f CFT action. Especially since several adjustments to its statute (extension of the mandate of the FATF Presidency, adoption of a new funding model, institutionalization of the holding of ministerial meetings at a fairly sustained frequency, etc.) comfort such a position","Utilitarian urban cycling, one of the possible solutions to mobility problems (e.g. pollution, congestion), has a low modal share of 3% in France, despite numerous efforts to increase it. The general goal of this Ph.D. thesis was to identify individual factors, such as representation, motivation, and perceived aggression from car drivers\u2019 behaviors that could help to better understand utilitarian urban cycling and could be used in its promotion. To reach this goal, three studies were carried out. The first study served to identify the main representations and motivations related to utilitarian urban cycling and to examine whether there were similarities and differences between cyclists and non-cyclists, through 20 semi-structured interviews in Paris area. The second study aimed to identify the weight of the previously identified arguments and to differentiate representations from motivations among cyclists and non-cyclists through an online survey (N=409) in the main French cities. These two studies revealed that advantages, levers, disadvantages and barriers related to utilitarian urban cycling are comparable between cyclists and non-cyclists; quantitative differences were found between representations and motivations. The third study was designed to understand whether cyclists perceive aggression from car drivers on road conditions, through an online survey (N=174) in 2 cities with different cycling modal share: Paris (3%) and Berlin (13%). The predictors of perceived aggression were intention, danger, knowledge, legitimacy, cycling identity and trait aggressiveness. The theoretical, methodological and applied implications of the results are discussed.","Since ancient times, equality between creditors appears to be the core principle of insolvency proceedings. It allows for a fairly sharing of the debtor's assets. However, existence and scope of that application standard are persistently contested. Many reforms, new economic orientations of the subject, added to the increasing place that securities law takes and the globalization of procedures have contributed to strengthen the debate around creditor's rights. Discussions about equality in the insolvency law though disclose a specific problem, due to an inadequate definition of equality principle in insolvency proceedings. More than anything, the concept of equality is ambivalent ; therefore, a single meaning for the principle is unmanageable. Furthermore, equality between creditors is not a plain rule but represents a full-fledged principle of law. That higher nature requires to be enforced at each stage of proceedings. In spite of subsequent amendments, the principle of equality between creditors appears to be the cornerstone of insolvency law. Traditional elements of the collective discipline remain and apply equality to all creditors. Development for differentiated treatments do not systematically lead to an unwarranted breach of equality. The breach of formal equality is accepted if the schemes carry out the proceedings objectives, or aim for protection of the best interests. Strong critics concerning the principle, and challenges about the expression are not unfounded for most. The legislator staged a number of unjust privileged treatments, with the aim of satisfying the personal interest of a few creditors. However, compliance with equality is essential in bankruptcy law for the purposes of sharing the assets and liabilities of the debt, and strengthen the imperative of moralization in business law.","The starting point of our research is based on the personal documents from the Mexican poet Efrain Huerta (1914-1982) newly acquired by the Mexican National Libraryand officially revealed in 2008. Efrain Huerta\u0159s work is quite unknown in France and threatened to fall into oblivion in Mexico. Therefore, our purpose is to analyse the evolution of the poet whose work has not always been considered to its fair value in its own country, from unpublished documents constituted by the letters and poems he wrote to his wife to be in 1941: Mireya Bravo. We deliberately chose to focus on the first three years of his mail (1933-1935) in order to study the author\u0159s poetic debuts. The epistolary work reveals his literary inspiration through the numerous quotes he uses as well as it demonstrates a style becoming more and more personal throughout the letters. As a consequence we propose to study the genesis of his first book of poesy published in 1935: Absoluto amor through an analysis of his letters and poems enclosed in his mailing","The branding of the Israeli identity constitutes the main topic of the present thesis. This theme is grounded in the Israelis\u2019 ever-present practice of self-criticism and sense of confusion and disorientation in matters related to identity. The debate on identity branding is a reflection of the \u2018Israeli spirit\u2019.What is the relationship between Jewish and Israeli identity? Should Israelis make a choice between the two? Does Jewish existence depend on the geographic space of the land of Israel, or does the Diaspora have a share in the identity? Does the new Jewish-Hebrew embody a necessary foundation for identity formation? Could Israeli identity disconnect itself from the Jewish past? How do Israelis deal with their two dominant cultures, the Western liberal culture on the one hand and the traditional Jewish culture on the other?This dissertation proposes to explore the complex nature of Israeli identity through the examination of a vast array of issues and events that have been of concern to Israeli society in the past and are today. Our goal is to contribute to and foster debate in the field of Jewish and Israeli thought. The life of Israelis wavers between exaltation and self-doubt in the face of existential and identity blurriness. Israelis constantly wonder about their physical as well as spiritual existence, and about the difficult structuring of their personal and public identity, on the brink of a culture war between believers in various creeds and between communities at odds with one another, in a country whose Jewish and democratic character is at the core of public debate and where political domination wavers between declining hegemonic socio-economic groups and a periphery on the rise.It thus appears essential to explore the ways in which Israelis view their own identity and the terms of the debate that could dispel the ambiguity of contemporary Israeli identity. In addition, this dissertation examines the ideological strategies that have been deployed by the Jewish leadership (statesmen, military chiefs, intellectuals and opinion molders) from the eighteenth century to the present and were used to instill the \u2018New Jew\u2019 identity brand in immigrant populations through national codes, culture and patriotism, while relying on the common heritage to create a series of myths and an ethos, as well as national narratives and symbol","When authors seek to go beyond the classical approaches, placing the decisions of the French Constitutional Council in a coherent, unified, and overarching order, they usually arm themselves with major theoretical models such as strategic analysis or the economic analysis of law. The recent opening of the institution to its own practices calls for going beyond these theorizations inherited from political science or game theory to develop an explanatory model closer to the empirical realities of the institution\u2019s functioning. Breaking with the peremptory and often uninformed denunciations of a Constitutional constitutionnel entirely subject to the executive power or to the influence of its secretary general, the perspective opens the field to a more contextual or \"micro\" approach focusing on the way in which the institution organizes, by itself, the production of its decisions, in short, how it legally determines itself.The study of decisions in the process of being made invites us to go deeper into the study of the acceleration of the jurisdictionalization of the Constitutional Council, which took place during the 1990s. Through their work of rationalizing the production of decisions, and not without mimicry with administrative litigation, the councillors and collaborators favoured the establishment of a form of jurisdictional routine, which placed the concern for the coherence of jurisprudence, its self-referentiality, at the heart of the preparation of decisions. Accelerated with the arrival of the QPC, the predetermination of decisions by preparatory work is still increasing. However, any determinism is ruled out when the minutes of the public sessions are examined, which helps pierce the black box of the deliberations. On the contrary, these records show the councilors\u2019 ability of possibly \"redetermining\" decisions, and thus the modalities that govern their production.","Farms attract new populations. They come in search of healthier food, for rural holidays and even to live and work. A visit rarely leaves people indifferent. \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d and \u201cHow does it work?\u201d when a farm hosts visitors has become the problem of this research. The epistemology to which it belongs comes from the enactment of a relationship with the World that allows the development of co-emergence of the perceived and the perceiver, allied with incompleteness. \u201cHosting oneself\u201d is therefore akin to setting in motion, a dance of corporeality. The body that serves as support for the empirical research is a situation of hosting at the farm where the author is also the farmer. The methodology adopted is essentially from the perspective of the first person, integrating rules by analogy and intricate hierarchies. The result is the proposition of a five-pointed star model of mosaic hosting. This modelisation of a \u201chost oneself\u201d - by and with a renewed sensitivity - integrates relaxation and the intensity of acts. The modelisation itself puts into question the implementation of hosting facilities on farms, but also outsideof farms, and encourages the field of possibilities to be opened.","Guillaume Apollinaire is undoubtedly one of the most famous French poets of the twentieth century. However, apart from being a key figure in the early avant-garde movements and the author of The Mirabeau Bridge (\u201cLe Pont Mirabeau\u201c) and The Song of the Ill-Beloved (\u201cLa Chanson du Mal-Aim\u00e9\u201c), the poet played another literary role less known to the public today. In fact, the \u201cimaginative prose\u201d (\u201cla prose d\u2019imagination\u201c)\u2014short stories and novels\u2014of Apollinaire was written in the spirit of \u201cl\u2019esprit nouveau\u201c and in accordance with a poetics of \u201csurprise\u201c which also shaped his poetry. Being an avid reader of curiosa and other unusual texts, the prosateur Apollinaire had a predilection for heretics, rogues, maniacs, ungraceful poets and eccentric artists. He was not afraid to write about shocking or unconventional subjects while aiming for aesthetic renewal. This very distinctive fiction writing belongs probably to a certain tradition in literature, where Apollinaire and some of his works remain among the genres and the authors who devoted themselves to fantastic tales, mysteries, anticlerical stories or other subversive texts. Since worldly experience and literary enterprise are inseparable in Apollinaire\u2019s world, it is natural to notice many signs of the writer\u2019s curiosity and his taste for the bizarre in his private library, his journals and his magazine columns. In fact, a large number of the so-called \u201ctrue falsities\u201c (\u201cauthentiques fausset\u00e9s\u201c)\u2014a term invented by Apollinaire himself who, as a brilliant raconteur, excelled in mixing reality with fantasy\u2014can actually be found in the writer\u2019s journalistic writing. As for his work of fiction, a similar tendency for mixing also reveals itself in the fusion of different artistic and literary genres. The \u201cimaginative prose\u201c shows the author\u2019s will to invent out of some existing \u201cframeworks\u201c, to create a new aesthetic free of genre constraints, while remaining faithful to the principles defended by the poet Guillaume Apollinaire.","Despite major changes during transition years since 1989 in Bucharest, the street children phenomenon which became visible after the fall of Niculae Ceausescu\u2019s communist regime has not disappeared. In spite of the abolition of the communist regime natalist policy, the demographic fertility collapse, economic growth, child welfare reforms and EU integration process, hundreds of minors keep sleeping roughless.The historical and longitudinal analysis of the phenomenon highlights lasting causal factors in the most vulnerable part of the population: the vicious circle of pauperization and marginalization undermines the most numerous families. The Bucharest street children phenomena is an inheritance of the communist regime, a sign of its enduring imprint on Romanian society. It is  correlated to \u2013 and overshadowed by \u2013 social realities such as children abandonment and institutionalization, which have prevented it from gaining political ground. Our work brings out how they have become invisible: on the one hand, we analyze the construction of the political (non)-representation of street children in postcommunist years, and, on the other hand, the street experience and trajectories of some of them, from 1990 to 2015. Being unable to prevent minors from settling in the streets is neither a Romanian feature nor a characteristic specific to poor or transition countries. The case of Romanian migrants in Paris, as well as the living conditions of a number of isolated migrant minors in Europe, illustrate how, when faced with homeless and right deprived children, a wealthy region acquainted with child rights\u2019 issues such as the EU experiences the same political challenge and dilemma as that of postcommunist Romania.","Visualizations have gained more importance in pedagogical material, in text books and in computer programs. Despite the co-existence of many different types of visualizations or graphical genres, learning research only has taken into account the distinction between text and pictures. This thesis aims at unpacking what, at least in learning research, seems to be one single holistic indivisible category of visualizations. We focused on teachers' and Masters students' thoughts on the existence of different types of visualizations and their presumed function in teaching and learning. Research on graphical representations is mainly focused on students' comprehension of graphical representations. However, there is very little research in extend of teachers' comprehension of graphical representations. In addition, the aspect of teacher training of graphical representations is also relatively ignored. There are two main parts in this thesis: theoretical and empirical. In theoretical part, we presented the literature on the existence of graphical representations in worldwide curricula. Remarkable works of cartographers who played important rule for the advancement of graphic representations in context of teaching and learning. And finally, classification of different genres of graphical representations was also exhibited. Empirical part on the other hand, based on three studies conducted with in-service teachers and Masters students' about their comprehension of graphical genres. First study was conducted with in-service teachers from France and Pakistan to investigate their basic understanding of graphical representations. Second and third study explores the Masters' students' categorization of graphical representations. In conclusion, it seems that the teacher training programs lack the training of graphic comprehension. Even in the domain of geography which is considered the major domain about graphics and graphic education, teachers were observed unfamiliar with many graphic genres. Overall, Generic graphical representations (i.e. line graph, pie charts, bar charts, maps and tables etc.) were identified more comfortably. However, classification of hybrid graphical representations (i.e. combination of map and bar graph or other hybrid graphics) was slightly difficult for the participants.","This thesis concerns the archaeology of the Greek colonies in Sicily. The main research focus is the domestic architecture and the urbanism of these cities, all located in Eastern Sicily. The time frame considered is the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, during the Sicilian Hellenistic period.Following a presentation of the most relevant historical facts, the investigation focuses on the site of Megara Hyblaea, one of the first Greek colonies in Sicily; previously unpublished remains belonging to the period at issue are presented and analyzed. This in-depth study deals first with architectural elements, then with the rooms of houses and finally the house plans; identified habitations are thereafter set in their urban surrounding. Furthermore, each of these themes is tackled in a detailed and critical way through five other sites: Camarina, Gela, Morgantina, Syracuse and Tyndaris. This approach makes the comparisons easier and allows us to place the example of Megara in context. Finally, other more succinct case studies of Punic sites and indigenous sites widen the scope of this study to the whole of Hellenistic Sicily.The synthesis of this data is organized into two sections. The first part lays out the current state of research on housing and urbanism of the Greek cities in Eastern Sicily during the Hellenistic period and presents the most debated issues. In the second part, the author proposes conclusions to integrate the hypotheses and the breakthroughs arrived at in the course of this study.","In exploring the novelistic texture of places, spaces and times in mauritians and reunionese contemporary novels and in a indian contemporary novel, this study aims to elucidate what the narrative fibers of the novels are made of, what is the imaginary of Mauritius and La Reunion creole islands while questioning their link to the Indian ocean. These creole islands, often considered, as lonely places, cut from the rest of the Indian ocean are nevertheless far from being hermetic to the space which surrounds them. From a connected approach of literatures and representations, we demonstrate how the novels are constantly reminding the Indian ocean places. If we think more easily the movement to the islands (movement of the bodies, of the stories, of the imaginaries) in contrast are less thought the passages and crossings that go from the islands to the Indian ocean. Paying attention to these less conventional movements, this study consider and prove that the Indian ocean and his texture, the way of writing, saying, narrate, put in words and texts this space, are woven by the imaginaries and the writings of the creole islands. Looking for the link between these islands and the Indian ocean, the sea (this aquatic entity defining the island condition) is en essential space for these imaginaries and writings. This primordial and founding relationship is thought as an inalienable component of the mauritian and reunionese novelistic textures.","This thesis proposes to analyze the sung work of Marie-Louise Taos Amrouche (1913-1976), as a literary, artistic, heritage genre, stemming from the Kabyle oral tradition, and, as a language and discursive strategy involving a transmission of knowledge and ancestral Kabyle know-how to reveal the important role of traditional Kabyle song in the transmission of identity and collective Kabyle memory long weakened, in particular, by colonization.A contextualized and historicized socio-cultural analysis of this work is privileged to highlight, on the one hand, new aspects related to the issue of the transmission of identity and collective memory through song, and, on the other hand, to demonstrate the originality of Taos Amrouche's artistic career, the universal scope of his work and his cultural struggle to safeguard the Kabyle oral heritage.In addition, a multidisciplinary treatment of the problem, including historical insights as well as definitions from the fields of sociology, social psychology, anthropology, literature, language sciences, the Kabyle imagination, allows us to rethink the notions of traditional song, identity, collective memory and to identify existing interconnections.This thesis finally demonstrates how Taos revived the Berber past, knew how to use traditional Kabyle singing not only as therapy against amnesia in order to heal his identity wound, but also as a tool of resistance, of cultural, political, historical or language, cultural identity and prospects for change in the future merge.","This study proposes to explore the existing relationships between cultural variables and attitudes, behaviors within the framework of a comparison approach (skills assessment, VAE, professional integration system), based on theoretical and empirical work which highlight major differences in behavior and attitudes in relation to the notion individualism\u002fcollectivism (Taras et al., 2012; Hofstede, 1994 ; Triandis, 1995; Oyserman & Lee, 2008) as well as the notion of relationship to time (Hall, 1971, 1979, 1984; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999; Bearden, Money & Nevins, 2006). We have chosen an exploratory mixed design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). We first intend to explore the problem with a qualitative method using a representative sample. The following phase consists in designing an instrument to measure the variables of the study. A first qualitative analysis with a group of 15 participants (10 immigrants and 5 natives) as part of a skills assessment process allowed us to observe the difference in the relationship to time in an orientation process. The second phase conducted with 239 participants in three processes - career-counselling, validation of acquired experience (VAE) and a training program \u201cEnhancing one\u2019s self-presentation\u201d (VSI, \u201cValoriser son image\u201d) - showed a difference between the two groups studied on several scales: relationship to time, short-term\u002flong-term orientation and more significantly in relationship to faith. There is a notable difference between the two groups in favor of the immigrant group on this point. It brings up the question of the meaning that one gives to one's existence (Bernaud, 2021), which could be the subject of extensions for future research in career counselling.","In this thesis, we take on Jean Cocteau\u2019s full body of diaristic work. The poet has eight different diaries to his name spanning from 1928 until his death in 1963 : Opium. Journal de d\u00e9sintoxication, Tour du monde en 80 jours, Journal 1942-1945, La Belle et la B\u00eate. Journal d\u2019un film, La Difficult\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre, Maalesh. Journal d\u2019une tourn\u00e9e de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Journal d\u2019un inconnu and Le Pass\u00e9 d\u00e9fini.We will begin by presenting the author\u2019s diaristic practice and defining his approach to the genre. The aim is to demonstrate this activity\u2019s importance to the poet on the one hand, and reveal the diarist\u2019s originality in this form of writing on the other.Then, we will focus on two essential elements in his conception of the genre: publication and readership. We will firstly attend to the writer\u2019s editorial work in order to understand where he positions the sum of his diaries within the field of literature. Secondly, we will define the typical diary reader and identify the different harnessing strategies the poet resorts to. It is with an eye on the potential reader, who is in direct opposition with Cocteau\u2019s contemporary critic, that the writer aspires to immortalize his unmasked soul.","The central question of this PhD thesis is: How the actors of territorial governance have built the suburban areas of the cities of intermediate subregional size in Chile between 1960 and 2015? This question was addressed through the analysis of urban and rural planning and regulation policies, as well as through their institutional interactions. In order to answer this question, we faced two obstacles at the beginning of the construction of this thesis. The first has corresponded to the absence of the concept of periurban, which is not officially defined in the norms or instruments of the Chilean State. The second obstacle has been the rare production of scientific studies on territorial governance in Chile.The strategy used to address the research question has been to separate it down into several components, supporting us in the construction and development of new analysis tools. We begin this thesis with a theoretical reading on the fundamental concepts of geography (geographic space, region, territory, urban, rural) in order to delve into one of the key concepts of the thesis: the peri-urban (chapter 1). Then we continue this reading with the second key concept that corresponds to territorial governance (chapter 2). Both readings were conducted using a scientific literature\u2019 state of several decades. Next, we continue by analyzing three types of spatial indicators: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and land use, to demonstrate the phenomenon of periurbanization in intermediate-sized cities in Chile (chapter 3). Then we approach the peri-urban political construction led by different actors of territorial governance using two of temporal research components. The first corresponds to the long-term broad view (1960-2013) that is focused on the territorial impacts of urban regulation instruments (chapter 4) and rural transformation instruments (chapter 5) led by actors at the national level. This approach allows us to analyze the decisions that have built the peri-urban since the 1960s in Chile. The second corresponds to the recent short-term view (2013-2015) that focuses on the analysis of power relations (chapter 6) and collective learning (chapter 7) of the peri-urban actor system. This system includes the actors that intervene from the national and regional scales, as well as the actors of the local scale that inhabit these spaces. The relationships observed in this thesis are those that currently structure and build the peri-urban areas of cities of intermediate subregional size.The conclusion of this PhD thesis (chapter 8) go back to these two temporal components or research\u2019s periods (1960-2013 and 2013-2015). In the first place, we conclude that the actors at the national and regional levels construct peri-urban spaces in a centralized and concentrated manner based on their decisions that they make and impose on the local level during the period 1960-2013. These relationships can be called as centralized, top-down model, or power gravity. For this, the actors at the national and regional levels used instruments of urban regulation and rural transformation (chapters 4 and 5). In the second place, we conclude that the situation changes during the 2013-2015 period, due to the new mandatory citizen participation regulations (Law No. 20,417; Law No. 20,500). In this way, the actors at the local level exert pressure on the actors at the national and regional levels through decentralized relations, bottom-up model or power capillarity using the same instruments of urban regulation (chapters 6 and 7). Crossing these two conclusions of territorial governance, we have verified and reveal a circularity of power. This combines a gravity of power related to a traditional top-down relationship and a capillarity of power linked to a new bottom-up relationship in the peri-urban construction in intermediate-sized cities in Chile.","This research offers to carry out a reflection starting from an examination of the conditions of possibility of peacebuilding, in light of history in the case of Colombia. The intention that guides it, is, at the start, to resume afresh the analysis of all that is agreed to be called the armed conflict, its political, economic, and social origins, its stakeholders, and the effects that seem to be the most important, while highlighting, particularly, the polysemy of the phenomena so designated. The normalization of violence, for instance. Dealing with the case of Colombia and its war and peace-related problem involves by all accounts a historical contextualization that emphasizes the structural causes of violence and the belligerent factors by taking the important foundations that are law, political philosophy, and political science.This introduction to the subject aims at establishing a basis to understand the complexity of the conflict and at providing forms of peacebuilding that are realistic as well as creative and useful and can be transformed in public policy as a result, operating amongst current armed clashes. These armed confrontations persist and change despite the signature of the 2016 Peace Accord between Juan-Manuel Santos\u2019 government and the members of the FARC\u2019s guerilla, because the stakeholders linked to the political and economic interests of the war are numerous and constantly change the war\u2019s own dynamics.This whole reflection is both theoretical \u2013 that is to say proper to this academic work \u2013, because peace is always, and par excellence, a philosophical and moral concept (linked to the concept of justice), but also practical, in the extent that it aims at obtaining essential knowledge that can, besides, allow to reinforce social actors\u2019 positive capacities (victims, reinstated people, members of institutions) to develop substantial procedures that focus on equity and democratic deepening and, that allow, these knowledges, to consider more efficiently forms of work in order to build peace in Colombia, while pointing out the limits","The study of monasteries has been limited to the church structure for a long time. The monastic buildings and their relations with the environment (state-owned economy and water network) are a subject of new research by architectural historians and archaeologists who, more often, opt for a particular aspect issue. This study considers the entire question in through a case study : the Abbey of Baume-les-Messieurs in the French Jura. This abbey was spared the important monastic reconstructions of the modern period, as well as the revolutionary destructions, almost all conventual buildings are still well conserved. These are the product of several construction campaigns. This rich archaeological potential makes possible to grasp and trace the evolution of the site's internal topography and the changes carried out according to monastic needs and practices, following a chronological range extending from the construction of the church in the 11th century up to the abandonment of the regular life in the 17th century. To do this, the various buildings forming the abbey couryards are plotted and studied by the building archeology, while using art history and written sources. This study would like to consider the long-time standing buildings organization and specific function, as well as the effect of the great abbots contracting authority. In addition, it would take into account the topographic particularities of the abbey's natural site, that is to say on the history of the builgings around its successive courtyards arranged in steps, on the slope. It is then possible to restore the different states of the monastery by means of a rich graphic documentation made up of drawings and 3d models. The integration of the levels allows us to grasp the monastery's morphogenesis, the frameworks of its evolution, the articulation between the various constructions and the hydraulic arrangements which determined the location of the abbey buildings.","We can be in one place in the world and take pictures of places located at hundreds of kilometers away. The distance, that up to now, used to be limited to our eyes\u2019 perception, has no more limits, thanks to new technologies. This thesis analyzes the position of the artist in the treatment of landscape in view of the choices offered between analogue and digital.This would be the multiplicity of the technological possibilities, that through the hands of the artist, allows to mutate the contemporary landscape. According to our hypothesis, the Mutation(s) of contemporary landscape, would not be based exclusively on a temporal continuity, following the technological evolution, that progressively forgets the analogue in favor of the digital. There would be this In Between that would be at the center of our questioning. The thesis develops itself in 3 parts, like a sort a tryptique: off-track - instants - out of place, based on our practice as artist. Departing from our Brittany origins, we will immerse into the Celtic legends (the \u201cAnaon\u201d, the \u201cintersigne\u201d, etc.) and cultures that will take us to Asia (the \u201cevaporated\u201d in Japan, etc.), shifting between the technologies, between the visible and the invisible, between the real and the virtual.In the end, the mutation (in plural) is one and many at the same time. This complex representation (in the sense of Edgar Morin) reminds that of Yi-Jin, of which his definition suggests the relationship between signs. It is not without the proximity of the Oghamic writing, that is an ancient Celtic alphabet. Our position is that the Ogham, in connection with the Yi-Jin, would be part of a new definition of the contemporary landscape.","It has been shown that the Greco-Roman antiquity had a very strong influence over the political discourse during the French Revolution. Thus, it seemed interesting to study the political debates of the XIXth and more specifically the constitutional debates, in order to validate or on the contrary to invalidate the commonly accepted view under which the antiquity would have had barely any influence during the XIXth century. Before modern times France experienced numerous revivals of Antiquity, also the question was to find out if there was another revival of the Antiquity under the XIXth century and if this revival was the beginning of something new or the swan song of the influence of the Antiquity. The present analyses propose to understand through a both chronological and thematic study, covering the period from 1814 to 1875, and by combining history of political ideas and history of the institutions, if the Antiquity had an influence on the political debates and the construction of the political models of the XIXth century. Indeed, as early as the first restoration the influence of antiquity already declined as compared to the previous period, but this backflow is in fact limited (the humanities remained in common culture) and also ambivalent (since an antic model such as the hybrid presidential-parliamentary-judicial interested the politicians). However, this led in the second half of the nineteenth century to a scientific neutralization of the Greco-Roman antiquity : its interest and value were put in perspective, because of the desire of the men of the XIXth century to write a national novel (in opposition to Germany), but also because they wanted a new political order based on some modern principles such as Contractualism, Republicanism and Parliamentarianism.","The place of Non Invasive Prenatal Testing(NIPT) is not clearly established for prenatal screening for Down syndrome in France. Our objectives were to assess the understanding, knowledge of, and attitudes towards NIPT in French patients and healthcare providers.A prospective multicenter study was performed in several French hospital centers between February 2014 and July 2015. A survey was administered to pregnant patients and to healthcare professionals.A total of 260 questionnaires were completed by healthcare providers. The average knowledge score was 5,38\u00b12,83(out of a possible 10). In multivariate analysis, the characteristics associated with satisfactory knowledge were: profession as obstetrician or genetic counsellor, age\u003c30 years, working in hospital or in doctor\u2019s office, more than 50 pregnancies followed per year. Among professionals, 92,7%n=241) had a favorable attitude towards NIPT.We collected 380 questionnaires from pregnant women. The average knowledge score was very low: 2,20\u00b11,88(out of 10). In multivariate analysis, the two significant characteristics associated with satisfactory knowledge was maternal age and having prenatal care in private practice. Among patients, 89,9%(n=328) had a favorable attitude towards NIPT.The level of knowledge of NIPT of healthcare professionals and patients is low. Many patients can not provide informed consent. However most professionals and patients are in favor of the use of this test. The input of NIPT in prenatal screening for trisomy 21 requires a considerable teaching program for healthcare providers so they can give balanced pretest information and non-directive counselling.","This research broaches the implementation of quality management in Tunisian colleges, particularly in the field of engineering. The case study is a college which experimented with this approach, sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education. Quality is the spearhead of the Tunisian administration so as to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country and to the competitiveness of Tunisian higher education. .  The implementation was embedded in the TQM framework and methodology that are outlined in the first part of the dissertation, as an international norm and standard. It enables a teleological implementation of quality management, resulting in getting the accreditation by importing a western and global approach to quality. This method structures the quality of products and processes and drives the operation management. However, we assume that there is a need for an axiologic axis to supplement the teleological axis in Tunisia so as to propose an integrated approach to quality management, which requires designing a compatible theoretical and methodological framework. Our research shows that the socio-economic approach to integrated quality management  is required to enable such compatibility. The intervention methodology doesn\u2019t consist in defining quality only through the objectives, but through the conditions and possibilities of change, and through transforming the very underpinnings and infrastructure of the organizations so as to better reach the objectives.","The fiction writings of Louis H\u00e9mon (1880-1913), for the most part posthumely published and interpreted according to various and contradictory ideologies by the literary critic, are an exemplar study case for reception aesthetics. Becoming worldy famous in 1921, when Maria Chapdelaine was published byGrasset editions, the writer is firstly perceived as the paragon of nationalist, catholic and regionalist literature. To the inbetween- wars readers, Grasset sells a traditionalist and reassuring novel. He turns it into one of the first french best-selling books. In Quebec, the elites wish to use H\u00e9mon\u2019s novel to promote agricultural work and to strengthen natality. It is the birth of what Nicole Deschamps will name the myth of Maria Chapdelaine. However, when the short stories and novels that H\u00e9mon wrote in London are published, the critic starts to see him as a modern and nonconformist writer. In the troubled times of the sixties, part of the critic advertises H\u00e9mon as an anarchist and an anticolonialist. Then, Maria Chapdelainebecomes an academic book in Quebec and is gradually forgotten in France. How did H\u00e9mon\u2019s polysemic work allow the critic\u2019s complete change of mind ? Why is it still so rich today ? Irony and polyenionciation are caracteristic features of H\u00e9mon\u2019s writing that make him, far from the myth, an eminently modern author.","The medina of Tlemcen is an expression of a multidimensional heritage, urban, architectural, cultural and traditional. Founded western of Agadir by the Almoravids, the medina has been enriched throughout centuries by civilizations which succeeded it (the Almohads, the Abdalwadides, the Merinids, the Ottomans, the French and the Algerians). The social and cultural footprints on the city of Tlemcen is the result of this legacy, full of emotion and pain, forged by prosperity and struggle.Eachsite, monument, art work or ordinary object, has a story to pass on. This complex combination is a legacy for many nations, especially those of the Mediterranean.Although the tangible and intangible heritage of the city has stood the effect of time, it remains dependent on various anthropogenic and natural factors that affect its resistance to degradation and its sustainability.It is in this context, and faced with this complexity of the heritage, it appears that a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is necessary to study the Medina of Tlemcen. We have chosen to tackle the subject from three angles: the first focuses on the history of the city of Tlemcen region, an approach that explores the potting soil of the medina. The second perspective aims to analyzing the forces that have shaped the city of Tlemcen in recent times. The last part lays out an approach to the management and the valorization of the heritage of the medina of Tlemcen.","This thesis focuses on the transition to work of students. It raises especially twoquestions: the question of objective employability opportunities for graduates of higher education,and makes in this way a contribution to the debate on the devaluation of diplomas ; the questionof the experience of the professional integration of young people in the French institutional andsocial context marked by the need to establish professionally.Figures of \"intello pr\u00e9caire\" or \"ouvrier bachelier\" embody the employment difficulties ofskilled youth. This phenomenon must be relativized: young university graduates have much lowerlevels of unemployment than non-graduates. Standard measures of profitability diplomas shouldlead to optimism : an additional year of higher education continues to provide 8% additionalincome. The devaluation of diplomas seems to be a \"myth.\" However, these optimisticconclusions are based on highly aggregated indicators : the performance in terms of professionalintegration are assessed according to the number of years of schooling or the level of education.One measures for example the chances of employability of baccalaur\u00e9at graduates and of masterholders and compares the relative profitability of these diplomas. In this way, the studies areunderstood as a continuum of knowledge : educational contexts, work intensity of each student,and especially the field of education pursued are not considered in the traditional measure ofprofitability diplomas. This thesis, based on a secondary analysis of quantitative data, precisesthis traditional measure by reintroducing the field of education. One can notice that at the samelevel of degree, there are wide disparities between training specialties in the probability of findingskilled jobs. The field of education determines as much as the level of training access to a skilledjob. Thus, this work concludes at the existence of local overeducation effects, located on specifictraining specialties.","This is an interdisciplinary study \u2013 essentially encompassing theater, psychology and neuroscience \u2013 whose goal is to analyze the transforming (and, somehow, therapeutic) potential inherent to theater practice. This work is divided into two core areas of   investigation: the first focuses on the dialogue that the theater has had with the life sciences throughout the history of Western civilization, highlighting the idea that the scientific study of emotions is presented as the main thread between theoretical and practical exchanges of the performing arts and life sciences. The second focus area of this research concerns the relationship between contemporary neuroscience of emotions, the work of the actor and the transformations that could occur through the theatrical experience \u2013 especially for the actor \u2013 on an ontological level. In this research, some neuroscientific concepts that prove fundamental to the development of a neurobiological approach to the emotional work of the actor have been developed. They are: neuroplasticity, the neuron mirror system, the brain gratification circuit and the conscious use of the procedural memory.","This research focuses on an original form of youth leisure, between youth work and commitment to the community. It relies on the archives of six work camps organizations and of the ministry in charge of their supervision. We follow several decades of evolution of a branch of youth work and popular education field. We first trace youth organizations' history: organized by adults to train youngsters in the values promoted by its founders, it is subsequently conquered by cohorts of young activists with new claims. Facing the current rise of mass youth unemployment, it had to reconsider  yesterday's ideals. Our second focus is the history of work camps as both an educational (youth training) and activist (assistance to a community) experience. Because the work camp provides a service to the community, it differs from the other forms youth leisure by the emphasis it puts on work: a training through work, an assistance by work. Education and service are linked in a dialectical process, both structural and cyclical: the priority given to one or the other characterizes and differentiates organizations and impacts the evolution of their methods. Through this study of the work-camps an original form of commitment to work and activism takes shape: volunteer service, between volunteering and wage labour.","Following the trend of international cooperation, comparative research across cultures becomes increasingly important. Consequently Sinology and Western culture could intersect at certain points of view, particularly around Derrida\u2019s political philosophy research based on the term friendship. Faced with political violence in the name of justice, democracy or human rights, Derrida states that the current policy is dominated by the disease of \u201cautoimmunity\u201d, by which democracy is locked to the within the territory of the State. So the universal democracy as the authenticity of democracy is not yet present. Considering that the reforms in the policy framework does not help to solve the \u201cautoimmunity\u201d, Derrida believes that we should return to the ideology by reflecting the term friendship as the root of human relations in society, in order to access the idea of the unconditional hospitality and therefore the universal democracy. This is why Derrida begins his research of political philosophy from the term friendship. In this sense, Derrida discusses the canonical friendship, namely the ancient friendship, Christian friendship and rationale friendship, in the western history, in concluding that the canonical friendship of the Western history favors the sameness by eliminating the difference, as far as the consanguinity, the frontier play a foundational rule throughout the Western history, which determines the conditional democracy based on the sovereignty of the nation-state. This way of beginning from the friendship exists also in Confucianism which acts as the essential of sinology, because of the image of brother, in other words the consanguinity persists throughout the sinological history as an axis, and in terms of structures of clan and family which monopolize the feudal politics of China. This allows us to note the similarities rather than the differences between the two cultures. In addition, face to the friendship based on consanguinity and the frontier, Derrida proposes a new way of friendship which contains the unconditional hospitality, in order to suppress the disease of autoimmunity, then lead to \"democracy to come\", even if it might causes a gap between ideology and political practice. Indeed, the \u201cuniversal love\u201d exists also in sinological history, for example in the theory of Mo Tzu. By which the society \"Da-Tong\" implying a universal democracy is always presented as the ideal society in the history of China. This may also make a gap between ideology and practical politics regarding the two cultures intersect instead of diverging. Face to the critiques concerning Utopia of \"democracy to come\" and the society \"Da-Tong\", this study aims at the confrontation between cultures, the transition between politics and ethics, in order to deal with these concepts with an objective attitude. In this process of comparative research we find that the conversation between cultures becomes increasingly important in universal cosmopolitanism.","The physiotherapist profession is officially born on 30 April 1946. From the late 19th century, massage, physiotherapy, gymnastics having entered the field of medicine and the law of 30 November 1892 given doctors a monopoly all care techniques, they will appeal to auxiliary assured they will pre-service training to better control. The War of 1914-1918 \"social evil\" will ensure the promotion of these empirical methods. The lack of professional masseurs who limited the access to these practices the medical profession will agree to delegate certain auxiliaries. It was not until World War II that a purely authoritarian manner are created medical gymnastics instructor profession and the medical masseur. These texts repealed in 1945, Law No. 46857 of 30 April 1946 designed to regulate the exercise of the medical professions gymnast masseur will create the profession of physiotherapist by giving him the legal monopoly of the massage. Very quickly this monopoly will be challenged and just as quickly the profession will manifest a desire for emancipation in relation to medical supervision. He will have to wait almost a quarter century (1969) to see its main claim result: a third year of study and 60 years for the Council of the Order (2006). The evolution of physiotherapy was, at first, hampered by the hegemonic designs of the medical profession and in a second stage conditional on regulatory harmonization policy allied health professionals conducted by public authorities and by societal choices. Subsequently the evolution of the profession will be affected by the establishment of quotas for access to studies that will encourage a large number of French youth (s) to undertake their studies in countries of the European Union. Subsequently, more and more EU citizens come to work in France. The upheavals on morals appeared in the years 1960-1970, have abolished a number of prohibitions, has upset the mentalities by promoting research of wellbeing. The physiotherapists who discontinued hygienic and aesthetic massage others vindicated. The first were beauticians who eventually win the case (massages to aesthetic purposes) followed by self-appointed wellness massage practitioners that case law has gradually legitimized. The creation of a Professional Order was the source of serious intra professional dissension. In this case, the energy expended was not put on the professional service, but of a certain conception of the latter. The reason has finally prevailed occupation, mainly united, has obtained significant progress symbolized by obtaining a fourth year preceded by a first year of university studies (PACES, STAPS, STC )","Childhood as a theme in literature emerges in the second half of the 19th century and asserts itself as an autonomous literary genre in the following century. This achievement is the fruit of numerous stories having been published by various publishers around the world. If there is no doubt in the fact that the latter is now one of the major genres in European countries, one might wonder about its place and its specificity in French-speaking communities. The aim of our study is to focus on Caribbean Literature in particular from the Antilles (Martinique-Guadeloupe). Childhood stories enable writers to reflect on their past and furthermore to approach and tackle issues of their society. Is it for them a pretext or a need? Patrick Chamoiseau points out, in Antan d\u2019enfance (1990), the first part of a trilogy, the origins of West-Indian\u2019s (Caribbean-Antilles) orality which is in a state of crisis due to the development of the city. In Le coeur \u00e0 rire ou \u00e0 pleurer, Maryse Cond\u00e9 describes her childhood in the Caribbean bourgeoisie, marked with the assimilation of her parents, rooted in a colonial society. For his part, Daniel Maximin, in Tu c\u2019est l\u2019enfance (2004), deals with a Caribbean society with a rich historical background, which in spite of having been geographically devastated by natural calamities, recover and forge ahead. We get to see a society which resist in a world where life is possible and hope is still alive despite of all these calamities. It seems that childhood stories, more than other genres, act like a mirror that the writers tend towards the readers for them to understand the society of the former, and its historical evolution, thus reflecting one among other images of the Caribbean\u2019s (Antilles) society. Furthermore, this enables questions relative to colonization, slavery, the identity, the language. In a society like the Caribbean one, where the question of identity is a key one due to its historical baggage, childhood stories, by adopting the na\u00efve point of view of a child, allow to say much more than other literary genres can, and thus tackle and secure acceptance of usually upsetting questions and subject matters.Key words : Autobiographie - story - childhood \u2013 slavery - creole","This doctoral thesis deals with the tax aspects of transfer pricing. ln the context of a globalized economy where the transfer pricing policies and legislations are at stake, it raises the question whether proper instruments of regulation can be set, and if the law is the adequate tool to that end.Indeed, numerous people consider that the major disorders in the regulation of transfer pricing stem from the Arm's Length Principle itself, due to its lack of economic precision and the absence of a global authority against harmful tax competition.To address the issue, we assume that there is more to the Ann's Length Principle than its common definition. Indeed, we show that it can be considered as part of a universal law aimed at neutralizing the effects of the tax differences in the international economic exchange. Such an assumption provides for a criterium to assess the quality of national legislations as well as the relevance of the groups' transfer pricing policies.By analyzing the French legislation and case law, we show that a thorough implementation of the Ann's Length Principle implies not only to copy article 9 \u00a7 1 the convention models, but more generally to capture its content and essence by setting the conditions for a proper cooperation between actors. We also explain the relationship between the lacks in the regulation of transfer pricing and the process of setting new rules that takes place around the world, describing the rationale of the BEPS plan and of the various limitations and compliance obligations that Governments impose to the taxpayers. Lastly, we show that building a national legislation with reference to the universal Ann's Length Principle implies a true partnership between the Government and all stakeholders, paving the way to a new manner of debating the law.","This thesis, which is part of the twin historiographical renewal of studies on the aulic phenomenon in Antiquity and the works on the Claudian period, shows how the imperial court gradually constitutes a new place of power, where the close entourage of the Emperor becomes the political centre of the Empire. By focusing on the principate of Claudius, an in-depth study has been done to cover ail aspects of the aulic phenomenon in its spatial, social, political and cultural dimensions. This study is organized around three major themes. First, a reconstruction of the framework within which the court of Claudius was operating. This entailed drawing a map of aulic spaces and restoring its topography. The second major theme focuses on the composition of the imperial court. After having defined and established a prosopographic corpus of some 150 certain members and 40 likely members, this corpus is analyzed according to a synchronic and then a diachronic perspective. Finally, the last section shows that the imperial court is not only a place of power but also a place for the staging power. The review of the mechanisms related to the political functioning of the court allows us to demonstrate that it is a place for collaboration and ongoing negotiation between the \u00e9lites and the emperor and that its existence is beneficial to both parties. The court must finally be visible: a detailed study of the forms of (self) representation of the court between 41 and 54 is thus proposed.","With the democratisation of mixed reality, the need for content is growing fast. In particular, a strong demand exists for interactive and scenarised content, in many domains. As diverse as those domains are, a common problem is the difficulty for the domain experts (medical staff, archaeologists, ...) to be understood by the developers who implement the applications. This difficulty often brings the experts to turn away from mixed reality, or to use it incoherently. Therefore, to ensure a better transmission of the experts knowledge and needs in mixed reality applications, we propose to give a greater importance to the expert during the creation of those applications, through two tools. The first one allows to build an augmented reality application through a direct manipulation of the environment, to add interaction in it. The second one is more focused on scenarios, and allows to record a scenario through the actions of the expert in the virtual environment. This thesis also gave birth to the use of interaction in virtual reality for virtual archaeological excavation applications, aimed at proposing new methods for the exploitation of archaeological 3D data, in diverse archaeological contexts.","Truly prospective technique is often at the roots of substantial changes to the law. It impacts on our social environment using legal restrictions to limit physical and moral damages by utilising the advanced technical process. The implementation of a new application, its use and commercialisation, should observe legal norms respecting the numerous and varied arms of law. As one of the structuring elements of society, law is impacted by technique and its application. Enhancing maritime surveillance and tracking vessels is now a priority to prevent and act against harmful damages resulting from maritime incidents. Technical developments lead to better adaptability of systems. It should also surmount the difficulties rising from the disparity of the threats and risk zones. It must be noted that technical innovations present significant advantages in terms of efficiency. The creation, commercialisation and use of any new systems must observe the various legal norms that protect the individual's rights. The law humanizes technique because it limits any misinterpretation of the factual elements and puts in place a necessary safeguard by preventing operational decisions that might violate fundamental rights.","This thesis investigates the modalities and conditions of Afghan women's reappearance in the public domain following the downfall of the Taliban regime. Based on a twelve-month ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2007 among different groups of women (women MPs, women's rights activists, female University Students) mostly based in Kabul, l study women's responses to various social anxieties that have emerged as a consequence of this new visibility. L argue that while the current 'reconstruction' project has opened new possibilities for women and created new imaginaries pertaining to their role in society, the ideological framework (i. E liberal notions of equality and human rights etc. ) on which it is grounded together with the strong military presence of foreign troops, have fuelled tensions at different levels of the Afghan society. Pressurized by their community to remain faithful to their 'culture', 'religion' and 'tradition' on one hand, and encouraged to access the public and become 'visible' by global forces on the other hand, women have been left with little choice but to adapt and find alternative ways to preserve a sense of autonomy. I describe these tactics as 'oppositional practices of everyday life' (De Certeau 1984), i. E complex practices of dissimulation which under the necessary appearance of compliance and conformity allow women to reconfigure social norms and create new spaces for themselves. More generally, this work engages with issues such as nationalism, Islam, gender, veiling, modernity, agency, rights and the public sphere.","The subject of this study is a semantic, pragmatic and discursive analysis of irony in Portuguese parliamentary debate. We study in particular the implicitation degrees of ironic criticism, the signals, the functions and the discursive strategies of irony. Our interdisciplinary theoretical approach covers the multiple forms that irony takes in our corpus, and includes operating concepts deriving from : the speech act theory (Austin 1962 and Searle 1969 and 1979) ; Grice\u00b4s conversational maxims (1975) ; the antiphrastic irony\u00b4s point of view (Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1980) ; the linguistic theory of polyphony (Ducrot 1984) ; the verbal politeness theory (Brown & Levinson 1987 and Kerbrat-Orecchioni 2005 and 2010) and studies on argumentation (Amossy 2000). The first part of this work focuses on the characteristics of the Portuguese parliamentary discourse and on the critical analysis of different studies on irony. In the second part, we study the different forms of irony in our corpus and identify the most common signals of irony. In the third part, we focus on the main discursive functions and strategies that underlie the use of irony in the discursive genre being analysed. This approach has allowed us to conceive irony as an axiological linguistic-discursive mechanism that aims to depreciate someone, while supporting argumentation and persuasion.","A new security environment in Europe replaced the bipolarity era since the \u201890th. The fall of communism reveals a Europe divided between Western countries and the Eastern Europe, region located at the crossroads of civilizations, tributary to the challenge, risks and hazards accompanying the Soviet collapse. Early \u201990th, a new security paradigm, the \u201cparadigm of freeze security\u201d replaces the old one of bipolarity during the Cold War. The lack of cooperation among the countries in the region is the main characteristic of the period, from the beginning and during unipolar moment. The picture of regional security show us two camps having apparently irremediable ideology: on the one hand, countries belonging to the former Soviet empire, each of them having their own concern about a possible sudden change of Russia, but with a strong Western orientation, and on the other hand, the existing Russian empire willing to reestablish a sphere of influence and to regain lost imperial glory, using increasingly a more and new coercion weapon \u2013 the energy weapon. In this equation of power, is interesting to observe the evolution and Romania role, a buffer security zone, by the language and culture belonging of Western civilization and by religion of Orthodox civilization. Ultimately, by its strategic position and desire to find again, its European identity, lost during Communism era, Romania will become one of the important pillars of NATO defense, in this part of the continent.","The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a constituent of the modern state, has forged its strong institutionalisation from the written word. Two significant contributions to this process are closely related to its archival repository. The creation of this repository in 1710, paved the way for clerks, ambassadors and ministers to begin defining and documenting the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A century later, the repository\u2019s custodian, d\u2019Hauterive, used these archives to produce regulations, reports and other memos aimed at reorganizing the department and the diplomatic corps. Among of these endogenous \u201cwritings\u201d, some were presented as \u201chistory\u201d and have, to this very day, strongly influenced the historical account of the construction of the modern state through the establishment of a bureaucracy and the professionalisation of diplomacy. By rendering an accurate reconstitution of the contexts in which these ministerial documents were written, and by considering them as actions at the time when they were deployed and archived, this work traces back the means by which we may gain an understanding of the social relations that governed the institution. From the protagonists, other histories of the ministry come to light, dependent on the shifting social history that focuses on micro-situations and individual action. The ministry\u2019s \u201crewrites\u201d, taken here as case studies, reveal the extent to which domesticity, power relations and loyalty, have accompanied the institutionalisation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.","This research deals with body modifications, whether given as intentional or not, just as psychoanalysis, when essentially considered in its Lacanian stream, looks upon them in their as well theoretical as clinical meaning. From the methodological point of view, this issue gets involved in a twofold relation between philosophy and aesthetics. On the one hand, we intend to resort to the critical tools brought by philosophers (Deleuze & Guattari, Judith Butler) in order to question the unthought and normative presuppositions that underlie the psychoanalytical viewpoint on body ; in the same time, this process lets the rational categories evolve under the pressure of some specific psychoanalytical results. On the other hand, the reference to art (literature, visual arts, cinema, body performances) will be used as touchstone and source for the reinvention of the analytical conceptual network ; conversely, the clinical investigation and formalisation lead to redefine and to shift the basic frameworks of aesthetic discourse (representation, surface, form, sublimation\u2026). As main thread and research hypothesis, we explore the harmonics of the \u00ab sinthome \u00bb, a concept extracted by Lacan from his thoughts about art and writing, so as to comprehend the conditions of subjective invention in its bodily dimension.","This research focuses on the use of storytelling in the field of teaching foreign languages. It is based on the analysis of a sample of stories from Algerian and French origins to demonstrate the pedagogical potential of this literary form.The analysis of our corpus has made it possible, to highlight the various storytelling operations in the area of language teaching.In fact, because of its cultural content, this literary type represents an excellent mediator to introduce students to the culture-target. We explained that storytelling was perfectly suited to help students become aware of the intertextual and intercultural dimensions of literary work. By appropriating these two concepts, learners build an essential literary culture to develop their skills in the reading and writing fields. Storytelling allows also to offer fruitful exercises in the reading and writing domains, as well as the linguistics aspects. The educational experience, conducted among a college students audience in Algeria, was an opportunity to validate our hypothesis on the usefulness of tales in the field of foreign languages teaching. Indeed, the establishment of our educational system, based on the exploitation of a series of tales, has led students to realize the value of enhancing their culture in the scripture domain.The intertextual and intercultural analysis of the tales proposed by the students in the macro-task of the post-test indicates their resumption of the grounds that are characteristic of the Arabic and European ones. Moreover, we found that students had improved the structural quality of their texts. Indeed, the formal analysis of their writings led to the conclusion that the majority of learners had produced stories that satisfied the rules of textual coherence.This result indicates that storytelling is an appropriate way to lead students to produce coherent texts. Furthermore, the macro-task has also been an efficient way to verify the evolution of their language skills.More specifically, the observation of their writings indicates that they have made progress in the lexical and morphological domains. On the other hand, students need more coaching, for all what is related to syntax, to control this aspect of the target language.","The position of nursing team managers in public hospital facilities has changed dramatically over the past ten years. It is now strongly focused on organization and administrative tasks, which draw them away from their role as nursing team managers dedicated to quality care to patients. Some of them resent this change in their job profile and find it very difficult to cope with this evolution. The intent of this thesis is to look into what causes this strain and to examine which elements in the training program could help prevent it. Among those elements, could research training (in a specific type of research to be defined further on) enable nursing team managers to enjoy their professional activity? First the author will define the function of nursing team manager through its history, its evolution and training methods. The author will then consider its specificities in the present day, based on three primary concepts: organization, management and support. Finally he will clarify the \u2018care\u2019 issue in the scope of the nursing team manager\u2019s activity. These elements will give an understanding of how the research approach can promote the \u2018art\u2019 of \u2018caring\u2019 in the nursing team manager\u2019s activity.","This thesis deals with citizenship education in France, a subject that has been on the agenda for some thirty years and the object of intense debates, especially in a national community deeply shocked by recent terrorist attacks.As there are but few studies on the subject, especially from an empirical perspective (Bozec, 2016), our objective is a comprehensive review of citizenship education in France, of how the subject is conceived officially and integrates national curricula as well as how it is implemented at school. In fact, we seek to answer the question: how is citizenship education taught in French schools?In order to do that, we compare the official prescriptions to the actual practices of the teachers, taking into consideration the work ergonomics approach, which tries to explain the differences between official recommendations and actual practices (Amigues, 2002, 2009). We have adopted a mixed method, both qualitative and quantitative (e.g. Larivi\u00e8re & Corbi\u00e8re, 2014) and focused on the analysis of official texts, the conduct and exploitation of free and semi-structured interviews and the questionnaire survey of almost 107 elementary school teachers.The main study of this thesis shows that there is often a gap between the official orientations of the Ministry of Education and the teachers\u2019 actual practices. In most cases, the teachers\u2019 response to the official recommendations is mediocre, both in the schools and in their classes. The results of the study indicate that the socio-professional characteristics of the teachers and the contextual characteristics of the schools affect the practical implementation of the official prescriptions in citizenship education. This research also enabled us to test a theoretical model we developed about the determinants of citizenship practices in the classroom. According to this model, the quality of life in school has direct and indirect effects on the citizenship practices of teachers in their classes, depending on the difficulties they encounter in the classroom.","To answer the above questions, this research aims to establish a comprehensive model to analyze the effect of Chinese cultural values on consumer technology products purchase through the role of perceived product meaning, internal behavior intention and external facilitating condition. This research addresses the following research questions. What are the fundamental cultural values of Chinese people ? Have the value systems changed across the generations in China ? What are the key factors influencing consumer's purchase of technological products ? And how do cultural values influence consumer's technology purchase behavior ? Totally, 1300 emails are sent in formal quetionnaire survey and 862 questionnaires are collected. Excluding the incomplete and invalid questionnaires (108), 754 effective ones are finally collected. Total response rate is 58 %. Thereinto, 381 responses are from sub-sample of post-80s, and the rest 373 are from pre-80s sub-sample. The model built has been validated through a structural equation modeling process. This research finds that Chinese young generation carries values that are different from their elder generations. Moderation and harmony standard from traditional Chinese cultural require people to be impartial, not to go extremes, and seek most appropriate ways to solve problems by balancing every aspect. Moreover, traditional Chinese culture requires individuals to comply with authority in a structured society. This research provides an in-depth view on Chinese consumers' inner world and the value changes across generations. The results provide practical implications for marketers to apply cultural value concepts in marketing activities in China. Enterprises should ally with consumers in spiritual perspectivs and make concerted efforts to help consumers realize and practice the fundemental values that they endorse.","In many medical fields, nanocarrier-based targeted drug-delivery (TDD) is likely to remove many technical obstacles regarding treatment. The lack of an approach based on variables such as potential impacts, acceptance, and acceptability could however lead to a mismatch between TDD applications being developed and users\u2019 needs and values; this mismatch could ultimately hold back their deployment. Based on an interdisciplinary approach for the analysis of impact and acceptability of emerging technologies, three main concepts of a new theoretical framework\u2014perceived impacts, acceptance, and acceptability\u2014have been operationalized. This operationalisation has been studied in the light of several variables, namely the nature of the nanocarrier, the clinical context of use, and the disciplinary and social culture of the respondents. An exploration of the impacts perceived, mobilized and weighted, based on a set of ethical, economic, environmental, legal and social (E3LS) issues allowed to establish a first portrait of the acceptability of this application. A descriptive-exploratory approach based on a mixed-methods design with sequential data triangulation was used. The data were collected in two phases, first through an online questionnaire (n = 214), and then through semi-structured individual interviews (n = 22). The final sample was composed of French and French-Canadian researchers involved in themes related to emerging technologies, all from natural sciences and engineering or from humanities and social sciences. The operationalisation of the theoretical framework highlighted the importance of distinguishing the device and the uses when formulating the acceptability judgment, revealing also the influence of the context of use on the acceptability of TDD applications. Disciplinary and social variations related to acceptability judgments were also raised, highlighting possible cultural sensitivities regarding elements mobilized in those acceptability judgments. These distinctions on how are apprehended TDD applications invite to go beyond traditional approaches of technology acceptance and to converge toward approaches of acceptability; those approaches also need to integrate how impacts on E3LS issues are perceived and weighted. The results of both phases of the study also showed that the operationalization of the theoretical framework was adequate to achieve that end. Ultimately, in order to figure and to understand the broad spectrum of possible impacts that may be perceived and valued in the acceptability judgment of stakeholders affected by the development of new nanomedical applications as TDD, the development process of those applications could benefit from integrating this approach."],"marker":{"opacity":0.5,"size":5},"mode":"markers+text","name":"1_the_of_and","text":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"textfont":{"size":12},"x":{"dtype":"f4","bdata":"EwH4QIGS\u002f0AuR6tAkY3uQG1V9kDEz9BAdFfYQMpbtUAuGsNAiTD\u002fQN0c6UAjDgJBUgnBQJxBBkHAyehARGb9QB3E+UARq8tA1qAGQZQLAkE9Ob9AIAcGQQ798kB2LdVAXrz8QEVsB0Hmn+9AGwewQKKN+UCmddJA1gbDQPHGBEEAyLVAZBLVQE6S4UAg+gdB5CXfQNnZ9UAqxgpBkQLxQBDb8UClEQNBsmbdQEL4yEBPjvBAKDbaQGKr9EBxXglBa+QGQcRW+UCl\u002fO9A\u002f3IDQSSq70AnZgdBIhwGQQr\u002f+kCK6+dAwfT+QNdU2UC30+5A7EftQEfp4kBWd89As8e\u002fQPjp2EB059tALpQEQc2E1ECajgpBx+kCQbrW\u002fUB3etFAtNrdQI+J0UC4WeBAkLX\u002fQHq16EDzNgtBeoALQV\u002fjr0BVfvRAwB\u002fIQIOr+EDAitVAYJbfQNLr80DidMJAoZQAQQFxBkGixb9AloAHQWmW7UCZ7wpBuL3jQBIKAEEFs9NAw4kLQatx+kABEqtAFGqqQEbMuUC+UgtBB9ABQTro8ED2zgRBzVIKQXUa\u002fECnawVBuTnwQE4+60BtyPFA6a4MQWf\u002fCUFg0edAXJHpQASXC0G4tv9ASHP2QGXX+UC4KOJAmlK8QDmLBEEjUu9AK8K9QK6q7kBy\u002fANBX20EQZZg3UAj9QZB4ePkQC8fv0DkRbZAYIy1QEro6kC3TedAuJ3zQBO\u002fA0ELZb5AHxrdQKJB20BdR+lA2U3dQHwoAUEQGO1A+joFQYOR5EBrivBAS4b8QEXm3kDBVPBAhgcBQfUywEC5k+xAMLnvQHZhu0AE\u002fORAsZ3zQI6N\u002fUDBBPlAoSLPQNy0wEDkYLtAAfi0QDgL80BbidRAC+HSQGRF+EDquQVBTHTkQOGdCkGBDgZBWtHyQAYyCkGbLO5AaWwFQcy9AUG1icRAX2viQMxS\u002fUBEg\u002fNAG+zgQHY\u002fBEEpt\u002fFAG+wCQQqB3kB\u002f7PZA6RQAQZBs3ECvfc5Ah08GQb8n5EDDSORAZB32QDOc80Ai5AJBsr8CQfBeAkFUeQFBr+PgQK4NzEB1zwhBc+77QFZ57UAdOQFBeDv\u002fQLxp9EDa779AWm\u002fPQPVC5UDAFdtAD7fkQA=="},"y":{"dtype":"f4","bdata":"a97kQBy00EDN5qlAtEvhQA8zy0D5cKZAmqmwQFB9s0Dn07JAudblQHfN50BKvKVAa4\u002fbQOkCn0BJ5\u002fZANiLlQKnJz0BJ47FALaCeQPBIzkC4wrJADkqfQPBCpkDC1bdAfT\u002fwQGOLo0Aa6cRAj+CvQMO68kD8Va9AgdG\u002fQHik7kDLhtFA+zuqQGwIuEAUe59ASEazQKoYoUBoqp1A9CWrQNAk60DsXNNARUndQPp6sEBOwq5AaXqyQGjA00BikKdAR\u002fKeQJHv9UBxnd9AmPfrQF3bqkCjTa9AKzPuQICV8ECBOvVAcc3rQJIH3kCTxulAuAexQNXs9kDXXKNAMIe0QNpV3kBQUexAMhTqQPVIrUCU459A22HCQJK\u002f50BihLdAY53dQBuzpUBV7KlAvkajQMtKvEBSfZxAGRqpQPmfr0AwR+ZAbfSvQCQE7UCWlapAGTu2QOCdokAtAcBA47K0QLSW8EBxmNVA5dyvQOG4r0BqbaVA0v72QG0V0kCOlrhAwoOpQHKR8ECIsadAjNmpQOp63EDQU5xAhy\u002fTQFLlrUABbLlABVKcQOrR4kBZGOtAuIusQDzo7kDlWqxA8\u002fygQKadqkBSFOhAlU72QEKZpkAVhNRAox32QGSQ2EDGybhA0bexQDCt8kBU\u002fuZASsTUQCaw6kCcc+5A6quoQJOW3UBBzadAvBP2QNXBtEAywtFAHgbSQOmw80CF+tJAHXypQLpIzUAEvMVAOELzQKYh6kAJhbNAegneQHopzEAX+vBAN1HxQKrsrUAj2OFAoS3lQLmb3kDeDK1A29bhQAOOtUACsbpArl7YQLYbyUCS4LZAVPSvQPWbrkCNVexAoDOjQMeN2EATP8dAFn\u002fRQOUGsUB5ZrVA10yjQE6k9ECXwKFA9sypQCCnnUD9I\u002fFAnVbbQIfzrED5VK5AN8vuQO2ozUDts9pAwLPYQGFf8EDWtuNAwha8QJlT7UBDaqlAXaG+QDZG20BfNfJAnBPYQEWno0DSZ7dAFq3sQAzA2EC8ubVAEJn2QOUis0CnOstA6Q+mQC\u002fK7UADVJxA4uvcQCyr3UAarJ5APPjGQOY56kDYGs5A\u002fHDXQLU69kA6AdtAfRSmQNTMuUBPTbhAetinQA=="},"type":"scattergl"}],
